	abstract = {Despite recent improvements in online accessibility, the Internet remains an inhospitable place for users with photosensitive epilepsy, a chronic condition in which certain light stimuli can trigger seizures and even lead to death in extreme cases. In this paper, we explore how current risk detection systems have allowed attackers to take advantage of design oversights and target vulnerable users with photosensitivity on popular social media platforms. Through interviews with photosensitive individuals and a critical review of existing systems, we constructed design requirements for consumer-driven protective systems and developed a prototype browser ex-tension for actively detecting and disarming potentially seizure-
inducing GIFs and videos. We validate our system with a comprehensive dataset of simulated GIFs and GIFs collected from social media. Finally, we conduct a novel quantitative analysis of the prevalence of seizure-inducing GIFs across popular social media
platforms and contribute recommendations for improving online accessibility for individuals with photosensitivity. All study materials

	abstract = {Heuristic evaluation, also known as discounted usability engineering method, is a quick and very effective form of usability testing performed typically by usability experts or domain experts. However, in the field of gestural interaction testing, general-purpose usability heuristic framework may not be sufficient to evaluate the usability validity of gestures used. Gestural interaction could be found in products from mainstream touchscreen devices to emerging technologies such as motion tracking, augmented virtual reality, and holograms. Usability testing by experts during the early stages of product development that utilizes emerging technologies of gestural interaction is desirable. Therefore, this study has the objective to create a set of gesture heuristics that can be used in conjunction and with minimal conflict with existing general-purpose usability heuristics for the purpose of designing and testing new gestural interaction. In order to do so, this study reviews literature of gestural interaction and usability testing to find and evaluate previous gesture heuristics. The result is a condensed set of four gesture-specific heuristics comprising Learnability, Cognitive Workload, Adaptability and Ergonomics. Paired sample t-test analysis revealed that significantly more defects were discovered when gesture heuristics knowledge were used for evaluation of gestural interaction.},

We build on the philosophy of Larry Laudan, who develops problem and solution as the foundational concepts of science. We argue that most HCI research is about three main types of problem: empirical, conceptual, and constructive. We elaborate upon Laudan's concept of problem-solving capacity as a universal criterion for determining the progress of solutions (outcomes): Instead of asking whether research is 'valid' or follows the 'right' approach, it urges us to ask how its solutions advance our capacity to solve important problems in human use of computers. This offers a rich, generative, and 'discipline-free' view of HCI and resolves some existing debates about what HCI is or should be. It may also help unify efforts across nominally disparate traditions in empirical research, theory, design, and engineering.},

To address this problem, we analyzed 68 published toolkit papers. From our analysis, we provide an overview of, reflection on, and discussion of evaluation methods for toolkit contributions. We identify and discuss the value of four toolkit evaluation strategies, including the associated techniques that each employs. We offer a categorization of evaluation strategies for toolkit researchers, along with a discussion of the value, potential limitations, and trade-offs associated with each strategy.},

However, due to the defining visual nature of data visualizations, extracting information from visualizations can be difficult or impossible for screen-reader users. To assess screen-reader users’ challenges with online data visualizations, we conducted two empirical studies: (1) A qualitative study with nine screen-reader users, and (2) a quantitative study with 36 screen-reader and 36 non-screen-reader users. Our results show that due to the inaccessibility of online data visualizations, screen-reader users extract information 61.48\% less accurately and spend 210.96\% more time interacting with online data visualizations compared to non-screen-reader users. Additionally, our findings show that online data visualizations are commonly indiscoverable to screen readers. In visualizations that are discoverable and comprehensible, screen-reader users suggested tabular and textual representation of data as techniques to improve the accessibility of online visualizations. Taken together, our results provide empirical evidence of the inequalities screen-readers users face in their interaction with online data visualizations.},

Blind students often rely on tactile graphics to access textbook images. Many textbook images have a large number of text labels that need to be made accessible. In order to do so, we propose TGV, which uses QR codes to replace the text, as an alternative to Braille. The codes are read with a smartphone application. We evaluated the system with a longitudinal study where 10 blind and low-vision participants completed tasks using three different modes on the smartphone application: (1) no guidance, (2) verbal guidance, and (3) finger-pointing guidance. Our results show that TGV is an effective way to access text in tactile graphics, especially for those blind users who are not fluent in Braille. We also found that preferences varied greatly across the modes, indicating that future work should support multiple modes. We expand upon the algorithms we used to implement the finger pointing, algorithms to automatically place QR codes on documents. We also discuss work we have started on creating a Google Glass version of the application.},

People with low vision frequently use mainstream computing devices, however how they use their devices to access information and whether digital low vision accessibility tools provide adequate support remains understudied. We addressed these questions with a contextual inquiry study. We observed 11 low vision participants using their smartphones, tablets, and computers when performing simple tasks such as reading email. We found that participants preferred accessing information visually than aurally (e.g., screen readers), and juggled a variety of accessibility tools. However, accessibility tools did not provide them with appropriate support. Moreover, participants had to constantly perform multiple gestures in order to see content comfortably. These challenges made participants inefficient-they were slow and often made mistakes; even tech savvy participants felt frustrated and not in control. Our findings reveal the unique needs of low vision people, which differ from those of people with no vision and design opportunities for improving low vision accessibility tools.},

Therefore, several native HTML-based templates and formats have been introduced for allowing researchers to write scientific documents, which could be access even with assistive technologies, e.g., screen readers. While HTML can be a good basis for guaranteeing accessibility of such papers, several issues are still in place when we consider the inclusion of non-textual entities in the main text, such as complex formulas and figures. In this paper we experiment on the use of one of such HTML formats, i.e., the Research Articles in Simplified HTML (RASH) format, extended for creating accessible graphs automatically out of CSV data. In particular, we introduce an extension to RASH to let the creation of accessible graphs.

	abstract = {Graphs are considered as one of the most important tools to represent information, and as such, they are widely used across the Internet in various formats to visualize statistics and data. However, for the visually impaired individuals, who can presently rely only on the ALT attribute of images, receiving and interpreting information displayed in graphs is a highly challenging task. This paper presents a novel solution to this problem, called evoGraphs, which is a jQuery plugin that allows users to create fully dynamic, customizable graphs that are easily read by screen readers. In contrast to traditional images, the proposed approach relies on HTML, CSS and jQuery components in order to create graphs while reducing page load time and making the graphs readable by voiceover software applications and screen readers. This paper presents the design and customization of evo-Graphs. Examples are provided to highlight the advantages of the proposed methodology by comparing page load times of traditional image-based graphs with those produced by evoGraphs.},

The objectives of the system are to provide the blind with a means of understanding line graphs in the holistic manner used by those with sight. A continuously varying pitch is used to represent motion in the x direction. To test the feasibility of using sound to represent graphs, a prototype system was developed and human factors experimenters were performed. Fourteen subjects were used to compare the tactile-graph methods normally used by the blind to these new sound graphs. It was discovered that mathematical concepts such as symmetry, monotonicity, and the slopes of lines could be determined quickly using sound. Even better performance may be expected with additional training. The flexibility, speed, cost-effectiveness, and greater measure of independence provided the blind or sight-impaired using these methods was demonstrated.},

We then introduce a specific multiple view system to improve access to bar graphs called SoundBar which provides an additional quick audio overview of the graph. An evaluation of SoundBar revealed that additional views significantly increased accuracy and reduced time taken in a question answering task.},

Results suggest that the information conveyed by visual and auditory scatterplots is used very similarly by the two modalities. Both visual and auditory scatterplots are quite efficient in conveying sign and magnitude of correlation, and the effect of outliers on judged magnitude of correlation is similar for the two types of data display.},

We interviewed the middle school math teacher throughout the deployment to learn about the challenges faced when teaching: lesson planning, execution, and review. We also observed how these changed when using GNIE compared to traditional teaching materials. During these 2 years, we conducted interviews and focus groups with students to learn about their attitudes toward tactile graphs compared to auditory graphs. With these in mind, we present lessons learned from the use of GNIE in a real-world classroom and implications for design of software to aid graphical learning for students with vision impairments.},

The disparity between human haptic perception and the sensation simulated by force feedback devices is discussed. Our strategies to tackle technical difficulties posed by the limitations of force feedback devices are explained. Based on the results of experiments conducted on both blind and sighted people, we suggested two techniques: engraving and the use of texture to model curved lines on haptic graphs. Integration of surface property and auditory cues in our system are proposed to assist blind users in exploring haptic graphs.},

This population has traditionally been excluded from visualization design, and often has limited access to data related to their well being. We explore how visualizations may better serve this population. We identify three visualization design elements that may improve data accessibility: chart type, chart embellishment, and data continuity. We evaluate these elements with populations both with and without IDD, measuring accuracy and efficiency in a web-based online experiment with time series and proportion data. Our study identifies performance patterns and subjective preferences for people with IDD when reading common visualizations. These findings suggest possible solutions that may break the cognitive barriers caused by conventional design guidelines.},

In this work, we investigate the problem of figure caption generation where the goal is to automatically generate a natural language description for a given figure. While natural image captioning has been studied extensively, figure captioning has received relatively little attention and remains a challenging problem. A successful solution to this task has many potential applications, such as: 1) automatic parsing large amount of figures in PDF document; 2) improving user experience by allowing figure content to be accessible to those with visual impairment. To solve this problem, we introduce a dataset FigCAP and propose novel attention mechanism. In order to solve the exposure bias issue, we further train the captioning model with sequence-level policy based on reinforcement learning, which directly optimizes evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines, thus demonstrating a significant potential for automatic generating captions for figures.},

Interpreting and making sense of such visualizations can be challenging for some people, such as those who are visually impaired or have low visualization literacy. In this work, we introduce a new dataset and present a neural model for automatically generating natural language summaries for charts. The generated summaries provide an interpretation of the chart and convey the key insights found within that chart. Our neural model is developed by extending the state-of-the-art model for the data-to-text generation task, which utilizes a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. We found that our approach outperforms the base model on a content selection metric by a wide margin (55.42\% vs. 8.49\%) and generates more informative, concise, and coherent summaries.},

Captions that tell accurate figure information and sound natural would significantly improve figure accessibility. In this paper, we present promising results on machine figure captioning. A recent corpus analysis of real-world captions reveals that machine figure captioning systems should start by generating accurate caption units. We formulate the caption unit generation problem as a controlled captioning problem. Given a caption unit type as a control signal, a model generates an accurate caption unit of that type. As a proof-of-concept on single bar charts, we propose a model, FigJAM, that achieves this goal through utilizing metadata information and a joint static and dynamic dictionary. Quantitative evaluations with two datasets from the figure question answering task show that our model can generate more accurate caption units than competitive baseline models. A user study with ten human experts confirms the value of machine-generated caption units in their standalone accuracy and naturalness. Finally, a post-editing simulation study demonstrates the potential for models to paraphrase and stitch together single-type caption units into multi-type captions by learning from data.},

	abstract = {Seven experiments investigated the heuristics people use to encode spatial pattern information through touch. Observers traced a tangible pathway with one hand and then answered questions about either the euclidean line between the pathway endpoints or the pathway itself. Parameters of the euclidean line were held constant, while characteristics of the felt pathway were manipulated. Experiments 1-4 showed that blindfolded sighted and blind observers increasingly overestimated the length of the euclidean line as the length of the explored pathway increased. This indicates a movement-based heuristic for encoding distance. Experiments 5-7 indicated that judgments of the position of the euclidean line did not vary with the position of the felt pathway or the extent to which it deviated from that line. Instead, the results indicated that observers relied on implicit spatial axes, which are movement independent, to judge position. These and other results have implications for theories of haptic encoding of spatial pattern and for the construction of tangible graphics displays.},

The present review addresses the question of whether the same grouping principles also affect the perception of tactile stimuli. Although, to date, only a few studies have explicitly investigated the existence of Gestalt grouping principles in the tactile modality, we argue that many more studies have indirectly provided evidence relevant to this topic. Reviewing this body of research, we argue that similar principles to those reported previously in visual and auditory studies also govern the perceptual grouping of tactile stimuli. In particular, we highlight evidence showing that the principles of proximity, similarity, common fate, good continuation, and closure affect tactile perception in both unimodal and crossmodal settings. We also highlight that the grouping of tactile stimuli is often affected by visual and auditory information that happen to be presented simultaneously. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and applied benefits that might pertain to the further study of Gestalt principles operating in both unisensory and multisensory tactile perception.},

The relative bias between vision and touch was reversed or considerably altered using both discrepancy and nondiscrepancy paradigms. This shift was achieved merely by directing observers to judge different dimensions of the same textured surface. Experiments 1, 4, and 5 showed relatively strong emphasis on visual as opposed to tactual cues regarding the spatial density of raised dot patterns. In contrast, Experiments 2, 3, and 6 demonstrated considerably greater emphasis on the tactual as opposed to visual cues when observers were instructed to judge the roughness of the same surfaces. The results of the experiments were discussed in terms of a modality appropriateness interpretation of intersensory bias. A weighted averaging model appeared to describe the nature of the intersensory integration process for both spatial density and roughness perception.},

	abstract = {The lack of access to visual information like text labels, icons, and colors can cause frustration and decrease independence for blind people. Current access technology uses automatic approaches to address some problems in this space, but the technology is error-prone, limited in scope, and quite expensive. In this paper, we introduce VizWiz, a talking application for mobile phones that offers a new alternative to answering visual questions in nearly real-time - asking multiple people on the web. To support answering questions quickly, we introduce a general approach for intelligently recruiting human workers in advance called quikTurkit so that workers are available when new questions arrive. A field deployment with 11 blind participants illustrates that blind people can effectively use VizWiz to cheaply answer questions in their everyday lives, highlighting issues that automatic approaches will need to address to be useful. Finally, we illustrate the potential of using VizWiz as part of the participatory design of advanced tools by using it to build and evaluate VizWiz::LocateIt, an interactive mobile tool that helps blind people solve general visual search problems.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: There are many problems when blind people need to access visualizations such as graphs and tables. Current speech or raised-paper technology does not provide a good solution. Our approach is to use non-speech sounds and haptics to allow a richer and more flexible form of access to graphs and tables.
METHOD: Two experiments are reported that test out designs for both sound and haptic graph solutions. In the audio case a standard speech interface is compared to one with non-speech sounds added. The haptic experiment compares two different graph designs to see which was the most effective.
RESULTS: Our results for the sound graphs showed a significant decrease in subjective workload, reduced time taken to complete tasks and reduced errors as compared to a standard speech interface. For the haptic graphs reductions in workload and some of the problems that can occur when using such graphs are shown.
CONCLUSIONS: Using non-speech sound and haptics can significantly improve interaction with visualizations such as graphs. This multimodal approach makes the most of the senses our users have to provide access to information in more flexible ways.},

	abstract = {Current approaches to accessible computing share a common goal of making technology accessible to users with disabilities. Perhaps because of this goal, they may also share a tendency to centralize disability rather than ability. We present a refinement to these approaches called ability-based design that consists of focusing on ability throughout the design process in an effort to create systems that leverage the full range of human potential. Just as user-centered design shifted the focus of interactive system design from systems to users, ability-based design attempts to shift the focus of accessible design from disability to ability. Although prior approaches to accessible computing may consider users’ abilities to some extent, ability-based design makes ability its central focus. We offer seven ability-based design principles and describe the projects that inspired their formulation. We also present a research agenda for ability-based design.},

Many sets of heuristics have been proposed, with the aim of evaluating specific application domains and their specific usability-related features. In addition, several sets of heuristics are used to evaluate aspects other than usability that are related to the user experience (UX). However, most authors use an informal process to develop usability/UX heuristics; there is no clear protocol for heuristic validation. This can result in sets of usability/UX heuristics that are difficult to understand or use; moreover, the resulting sets of heuristics may not be effective or efficient evaluation tools. This article presents a formal methodology for developing usability/user experience heuristics. The methodology was applied in practice in several case studies; it was also validated through expert opinions.},

In this paper, we propose Data Donors, a conceptual framework proposing the enablement of users with the capacity to help others to do so by donating their mobile interaction data and knowledge. Inspired by charitable donations, we outline the Data Donors framework and discuss three applications that are being developed under the data donning paradigm.

Mobile casual games are increasingly popular as their simplicity, lack of commitment required and neglect for particular special skills goes hand-in-hand with the reduced and partitioned time spans associated with daily contexts. Gaming possibilities for blind people are scarce. The extra demands imposed by mobile interfaces and contexts augments this exclusion. Given the paucity of mobile games for blind people along with the recognized benefits of such gaming experiences, we present an audio-based puzzle game for blind people. In this paper, we depict the iterative (participatory) design of the game along with a preliminary evaluation with 13 blind participants. Results show that the game is fun and challenging and suggest that playable counterparts of visualbased games are feasible even in restrictive contexts as is the mobile one.},

Current methods to detect risk of dyslexia are language speciﬁc, expensive, or do not scale well because they require a professional or extensive equipment. A central challenge to detecting dyslexia is han­ dling its diﬀering manifestations across languages. To ad­ dress this, we designed a browser-based game, Dytective, to detect risk of dyslexia across the English and Spanish lan­ guages. Dytective consists of linguistic tasks informed by analysis of common errors made by persons with dyslexia. To evaluate Dytective, we conducted a user study with 60 English and Spanish speaking children between 7 and 12 years old. We found children with and without dyslexia dif­ fered signiﬁcantly in their performance on the game. Our results suggest that Dytective is able to diﬀerentiate school age children with and without dyslexia in both English and Spanish speakers.},

In this work, we examine approaches to support this marginalized user group, focusing on visual disabilities.

The study findings suggest that participants actively try to construct an image of visualizations in their head while listening to alternative texts and wish to carry out visualization tasks (e.g., retrieve specific values) as sighted viewers would.

	abstract = {For all its potential in supporting data analysis, particularly in exploratory situations, visualization also creates barriers: accessibility for blind and visually impaired individuals. Regardless of how effective a visualization is, providing equal access for blind users requires a paradigm shift for the visualization research community. To enact such a shift, it is not sufficient to treat visualization accessibility as merely another technical problem to overcome. Instead, supporting the millions of blind and visually impaired users around the world who have equally valid needs for data analysis as sighted individuals requires a respectful, equitable, and holistic approach that includes all users from the onset. In this paper, we draw on accessibility research methodologies to make inroads towards such an approach. We first identify the people who have specific insight into how blind people perceive the world: orientation and mobility (O\&M) experts, who are instructors that teach blind individuals how to navigate the physical world using non-visual senses. We interview 10 O\&M experts-all of them blind-to understand how best to use sensory substitution other than the visual sense for conveying spatial layouts. Finally, we investigate our qualitative findings using thematic analysis. While blind people in general tend to use both sound and touch to understand their surroundings, we focused on auditory affordances and how they can be used to make data visualizations accessible-using sonification and auralization. However, our experts recommended supporting a combination of senses-sound and touch-to make charts accessible as blind individuals may be more familiar with exploring tactile charts. We report results on both sound and touch affordances, and conclude by discussing implications for accessible visualization for blind individuals.},

Our findings quantitatively support many conventional qualitative design guidelines, including that (1) titles and supporting text should convey the message of a visualization, (2) if used appropriately, pictograms do not interfere with understanding and can improve recognition, and (3) redundancy helps effectively communicate the message. Importantly, we show that visualizations memorable “at-a-glance” are also capable of effectively conveying the message of the visualization. Thus, a memorable visualization is often also an effective one.},

We describe how the visual system can quickly extract broad statistics from a display, whereas poorly designed displays can lead to misperceptions and illusions. Extracting global statistics is fast, but comparing between subsets of values is slow. Effective graphics avoid taxing working memory, guide attention, and respect familiar conventions. Data visualizations can play a critical role in teaching and communication, provided that designers tailor those visualizations to their audience.},

	abstract = {When forecasting events, multiple types of uncertainty are often inherently present in the modeling process. Various uncertainty typologies exist, and each type of uncertainty has different implications a scientist might want to convey. In this work, we focus on one type of distinction between direct quantitative uncertainty and indirect qualitative uncertainty. Direct quantitative uncertainty describes uncertainty about facts, numbers, and hypotheses that can be communicated in absolute quantitative forms such as probability distributions or confidence intervals. Indirect qualitative uncertainty describes the quality of knowledge concerning how effectively facts, numbers, or hypotheses represent reality, such as evidence confidence scales proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A large body of research demonstrates that both experts and novices have difficulty reasoning with quantitative uncertainty, and visualizations of uncertainty can help with such traditionally challenging concepts. However, the question of if, and how, people may reason with multiple types of uncertainty associated with a forecast remains largely unexplored. In this series of studies, we seek to understand if individuals can integrate indirect uncertainty about how “good” a model is (operationalized as a qualitative expression of forecaster confidence) with quantified uncertainty in a prediction (operationalized as a quantile dotplot visualization of a predicted distribution). Our first study results suggest that participants utilize both direct quantitative uncertainty and indirect qualitative uncertainty when conveyed as quantile dotplots and forecaster confidence. In manipulations where forecasters were less sure about their prediction, participants made more conservative judgments. In our second study, we varied the amount of quantified uncertainty (in the form of the SD of the visualized distributions) to examine how participants’ decisions changed under different combinations of quantified uncertainty (variance) and qualitative uncertainty (low, medium, and high forecaster confidence). The second study results suggest that participants updated their judgments in the direction predicted by both qualitative confidence information (e.g., becoming more conservative when the forecaster confidence is low) and quantitative uncertainty (e.g., becoming more conservative when the variance is increased). Based on the findings from both experiments, we recommend that forecasters present qualitative expressions of model confidence whenever possible alongside quantified uncertainty.},

	abstract = {A viewer can extract many potential patterns from any set of visualized data values. But that means that two people can see different patterns in the same visualization, potentially leading to miscommunication. Here, we show that when people are primed to see one pattern in the data as visually salient, they believe that naïve viewers will experience the same visual salience. Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what naïve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly influenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would find the same patterns to be most visually salient. This result reflects a psychological phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge, where an expert struggles to re-create the state of mind of a novice. The present findings show that the curse of knowledge also plagues the visual perception of data, explaining why people can fail to connect with audiences when they communicate patterns in data.},

	abstract = {The paper considers what it means to capture design knowledge by embodying it in procedures that are expressible in a computer program, distinguishing several possible purposes for such an exercise. Following the lead of David Marr's computational approach to vision, emphasis is placed on ‘phenomenological equivalence’ — that is, first defining the functions of designing, and then specifying how people design. The paper goes on to describe design phenomena that a computational strategy of this kind would have to reproduce. All of them are integral to a view of designing as reflective conversation with the materials of a design situation, and depend on the idea of distinctive design worlds constructed by the designer. These phenomena include: the designer's seeing-moving-seeing, the construction of figures from marks on a page, the appreciation of design qualities, the evolution of design intentions in the course of the design process, the recognition of unintended consequences of move experiments, the storage and deployment of prototypes, which must be placed in transaction with the design situation, and communication across divergent design worlds. Considered as performance criteria for a phenomenologically equivalent computational designer, these phenomena are formidable and threatening. Considered as performance criteria for the construction of a computer-based design assistant, however, they may be highly evocative.},

In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.},

By analyzing the 2009 VAST Challenge reviews, we gained a better understanding of what is important to our reviewers, both visualization researchers and professional analysts. We also report on a small user study with professional analysts to determine the important factors that they use in evaluating visual analysis systems. We also looked at guidelines developed by researchers in various domains and synthesized the results from these three efforts into an initial set for use by others in the community. One challenge for future visual analytics systems is to help in the generation of reports. In our user study, we also worked with analysts to understand the criteria they used to evaluate the quality of analytic reports. We propose that this knowledge will be useful as researchers look at systems to automate some of the report generation.1 From these two efforts, we produced some initial guidelines for evaluating visual analytics environments and for the evaluation of analytic reports. It is important to understand that these guidelines are initial drafts and are limited in scope as the visual analytics systems we evaluated were used in specific tasks. We propose these guidelines as a starting point for the Visual Analytics Community.},
