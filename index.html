Existing visualizations often lack an underlying navigable structure, fail to engage necessary input modalities, and rely heavily on visual-only rendering practices. These limitations exclude people with disabilities, especially users of assistive technologies. To address these challenges, we present Data Navigator: a system built on a dynamic graph structure, enabling developers to construct navigable lists, trees, graphs, and flows as well as spatial, diagrammatic, and geographic relations. Data Navigator supports a wide range of input modalities: screen reader, keyboard, speech, gesture detection, and even fabricated assistive devices. We present 3 case examples with Data Navigator, demonstrating we can provide accessible navigation structures on top of raster images, integrate with existing toolkits at scale, and rapidly develop novel prototypes. Data Navigator is a step towards making accessible data visualizations easier to design and implement.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" id="introduction"><h1>Introduction</h1><p>While there is a growing interest in making data visualizations more
accessible for people with disabilities, current toolkit and
practitioner efforts have not risen to the challenge at scale. Major
data visualization tools and ecosystems predominantly produce
inaccessible artifacts for many users with disabilities. We believe this
is largely a gap caused by a lack of underlying structure in most
visualizations, failure to engage the input modalities used by people
with disabilities, and over-reliance on visual-only rendering
practices.</p>
<p>Users who are blind or low vision commonly use screen readers and
users with motor and dexterity disabilities often do not use "pointer"
(precise mouse and touch) based input technology when interacting with
digital interfaces. Many users with motor and dexterity disabilities use
discrete navigation controls, either sequentially using keyboard-like
input, or directly using voice or text commands.</p>
<p>Most interactive visualizations simply focus on pointer-based input:
they can be clicked or tapped, hovered, and selected in order to perform
analytical tasks. This excludes non-pointer input technologies. These
devices require consideration for the navigation structure and
underlying semantics of a visual interface.</p>
<p>However, building navigable spatial and relational interfaces is a
difficult task with current resources.</p>
<p>Raster images, arguably the most common format for creating and
disseminating data visualizations, currently cannot be made into
navigable structures. These are only described using alt text, which
limits their usefulness to screen reader users.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, more accessible rendering formats like SVG with ARIA
(accessible rich internet applications) properties are more resource
intensive than raster approaches, like WebGL-powered HTML canvas or
pre-rendered PNG files. SVG puts a burden on low-bandwidth users and a
ceiling on how many data points can be rendered in memory.</p>
<p>In addition, ARIA itself has 2 major limitations. First, when added
to interface elements, ARIA only provides <em>screen reader</em> access,
which means that developers must build a solution from scratch for other
navigation input modalities. Second, ARIA’s linear navigation structure
can be time-consuming for screen reader users if a visualization has
many elements. This may impede how essential insights and relationships
are understood&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Sorge2016Polyfilling Godfrey2018Accessible Zong2022Rich Thompson2023Chart Jung2022Communicating Sharif2021Understanding">[<a href="#ref-Sorge2016Polyfilling" id="Sorge2016Polyfilling01" aria-label="37, V.

<p>Some emerging approaches have sought to address this serial
limitation of data navigation and provide richer experiences for screen
reader users&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Sorge2016Polyfilling Godfrey2018Accessible Zong2022Rich Thompson2023Chart">[<a href="#ref-Sorge2016Polyfilling" id="Sorge2016Polyfilling11" aria-label="37, V.

However, these approaches rely on a tree-based navigation structure
which is often not an appropriate choice for visualizations of
relational, spatial, diagrammatic, or geographic data. Many
visualization structures are currently unaddressed.</p>
<p>Zong <span>et&nbsp;al</span> stress that in order to realize richer, more
accessible data visualizations, the responsibility must be shared by
“toolkit makers,” the practitioners who design, build, and maintain
visualization authoring technologies&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Zong2022Rich">[<a href="#ref-Zong2022Rich" id="Zong2022Rich21" aria-label="47, J. Zong" title="47, J. Zong" role="doc-noteref">47</a>]</span>. Our contribution is towards that aim,
to make more accessible data experiences easier to design and implement
within existing visualization work.</p>
<p>We present Data Navigator. Data Navigator is a toolkit built on a
graph data structure, within which a broad array of common data
structures can be expressed (including list, tree, graph, relational,
spatial, diagrammatic, and geographic structures). Data Navigator also
exposes an interface that supports interactions via screen reader,
keyboard, gesture-based touch, motion gesture, voice, as well as
fabricated and DIY input modalities. Data Navigator provides expressive
structure and semantic rendering capabilities as well as the ability for
developers to use their own, preferred method of rendering.</p>
<p>Data Navigator builds upon human-studies motivated work on accessible
navigation&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Zong2022Rich Thompson2023Chart">[<a href="#ref-Zong2022Rich" id="Zong2022Rich31" aria-label="47, J. Zong" title="47, J.

generalizable resource for visualization practitioners. We contribute a
high-level system design for our node-edge graph-based solution as well
as an implementation of this system on the web, using JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS. Through our case examples we also demonstrate that our
generalized approach is suitable for replication of existing best
practices from other systems, integration into existing visualization
toolkit ecosystems, and development of novel prototypes for accessible
navigation. We illustrate how Data Navigator’s use of generic edges,
dynamic navigation rules, and loose coupling between navigation and
visual encodings provides practitioners robust, expressive, control over
their system designs.</p>

<p>Our contribution is an attempt to bridge the gap between research and
practice more effectively across broad ecosystems in order to enable
deeper and more expressive accessible data navigation interfaces. Below
we outline the prior research and standards that inform our project, a

navigation, and then accessible input device considerations.</p>

<p>Research and standards are both somewhat limited by a strong bias

Marriott <span>et&nbsp;al</span> also found that visual disability

many other demographics face unstudied.</p>
<p>However, despite the heavy focus on visual disabilities, the work
that does exist in the visualization community is deeply valuable and
serves as an important starting point for our technical
contribution.</p>
<h3 id="accessible-navigation-design-considerations">Accessible
navigation design considerations</h3>
<p>Zong <span>et&nbsp;al</span>’s research, which was conducted as in-depth
co-design work and validated in usability studies involving blind
participants, presented a design space for accessible, rich screen
reader navigation of data visualizations. They organized their design
space into <em>structure, navigation,</em> and <em>description</em>
considerations and demonstrated example <em>structural</em>,
<em>spatial</em>, and <em>direct</em> tree-based approaches&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Zong2022Rich">[<a href="#ref-Zong2022Rich" id="Zong2022Rich41" aria-label="47, J. Zong" title="47, J. Zong" role="doc-noteref">47</a>]</span>.</p>

these design dimensions as the best starting point for our work,

Unfortunately, most accessibility standards and guidelines do not
explicitly engage how to structure data navigation.</p>
<p>Despite this, existing accessibility standards bodies like the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines do stress the importance of accurate,
functional semantics in order for screen reader users to know how to
interact with elements&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="WAI2021Semantics">[<a href="#ref-WAI2021Semantics" id="WAI2021Semantics01" aria-label="43, WAI" title="43, WAI" role="doc-noteref">43</a>]</span>. For interactive visualizations
this means that button-like or link-like behavior should expressly be
made using elements that are semantically buttons and links. Our system
should be capable of expressing meaningful semantics to users of
assistive technologies.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="visualization-toolkits-and-technical-work"><h2>Visualization
toolkits and technical work</h2>
<p>Unfortunately while many data visualization toolkits offer some
degree of accessible navigation and interaction capabilities to
developers, very few toolkits currently out there offer control over the
important aspects of accessible data navigation design. Replicating
existing research and strategies, remediating toolkit ecosystems, and
building novel prototypes are all difficult or impossible to do due to
the current lack of toolkit capabilities.</p>
<p>Existing data visualization toolkits have 3 major limitations that we
wanted to address in the design of Data Navigator:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Built on visual materials</strong>: toolkits produce
either raster or SVG-based visualizations, neither of which are focused
towards designing navigable, semantic structures. As a consequence, many
visualizations are simply entirely inaccessible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lacking relational expressiveness</strong>: When data
navigation <em>is</em> provided, the navigation is based on either a
tree or list structure (see&nbsp;<a href="#Figure2" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="existing">Figure 2</a>).
The consequence of this limitation is that many other non-list and
non-tree data relationships become difficult or impossible to represent
without overly tedious navigation or inefficient architecture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Designed only for screen reader interaction</strong>:
When <em>accessible</em> data navigation is provided, it is generally
only made possible through SVG with ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet
Application) attributes. ARIA is primarily only leveraged by screen
readers&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="WAI2017ARIA">[<a href="#ref-WAI2017ARIA" id="WAI2017ARIA01" aria-label="40, WAI" title="40, WAI" role="doc-noteref">40</a>]</span>. If a
data element can be clicked and performs some form of function, only
direct pointer (mouse and touch) and screen reader users are included.
The consequence of this is that a wide array of other input devices,
many used as assistive technologies by people with motor and dexterity
disabilities, are excluded.</p></li>

<p>De-coupling rendered, visual structures from meaningful and effective
navigation experiences can provide richer experiences for screen reader
users&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Zong2022Rich">[<a href="#ref-Zong2022Rich" id="Zong2022Rich61" aria-label="47, J. Zong" title="47, J. Zong" role="doc-noteref">47</a>]</span>. Prior
research and industry work, with the exception of the <em>Visa Chart
Components</em> library&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="VisaVisa">[<a href="#ref-VisaVisa" id="VisaVisa01" aria-label="39, Visa" title="39, Visa" role="doc-noteref">39</a>]</span>, has relied heavily on a 1 to 1
relationship between structure (the encoded marks) and navigation. This
emerging work is significant, because it paves the way for considering
the design dimensions of accessible data interaction and navigation
without dependence on a visually encoded space.</p>
<p><em>Olli’s</em> approach has been to build ready-to-go adaptors that
automatically build multiple tree structures for a few ecosystems
(<em>Vega</em>, <em>Vega-Lite</em>, and <em>Observable Plot</em>) and is
entirely uncoupled from a data visualization’s graphics. Their approach
renders navigable tree structures <em>underneath</em> a
visualization.</p>
<p>Other than <em>Olli</em>, <em>Highcharts</em>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="HighsoftHighcharts">[<a href="#ref-HighsoftHighcharts" id="HighsoftHighcharts01" aria-label="16, Highsoft" title="16, Highsoft" role="doc-noteref">16</a>]</span>, <em>Visa Chart Components</em>,

Godfrey" role="doc-noteref">14</a>]</span> also
primarily provide tree and list navigation structures across all of
their chart types. These toolkits render their structures <em>upon</em>
the visualization’s graphic space. These tools also provide some degree
of support for other assistive technologies and input modalities,
although are limited exclusively to SVG rendering.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these toolkits lack capabilities for dealing with
graph, relational, spatial, diagrammatic, and geographic data
structures.</p>
<h3 id="serial-list-based-approaches">Serial, list-based approaches</h3>
<p>Toolkits like <em>Vega-Lite</em>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Satyanarayan2017VegaLite">[<a href="#ref-Satyanarayan2017VegaLite" id="Satyanarayan2017VegaLite01" aria-label="31, A. Satyanarayan" title="31, A. Satyanarayan" role="doc-noteref">31</a>]</span> and <em>Observable
Plot</em> only provide basic screen reader support through ARIA
attributes when visualizations are rendered using SVG. These libraries
do not currently provide additional access to other assistive
technologies and input modalities.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s <em>PowerBI</em> largely uses a serial structure,
although it has tree-like elements as well. <em>PowerBI</em> generally
provides the same access to keyboard users as it does to screen readers,
although not completely.</p>
<h3 id="no-navigation-provided">No navigation provided</h3>
<p>Other visualization tools, like <em>ggplot2</em> or
<em>Datawrapper</em>, <em>Tableau</em>, as well as both
<em>Vega-Lite</em> and <em>Highcharts</em> (when rendering to canvas),
produce raster images and have no navigable structure available. Raster,
or pixel-based graphics have been an accessibility burden since the
early days of graphical user interface development&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Boyd1990Graphical">[<a href="#ref-Boyd1990Graphical" id="Boyd1990Graphical01" aria-label="3, L. H. Boyd" title="3, L. H. Boyd" role="doc-noteref">3</a>]</span>. Practitioners
who use these toolkits can only provide alternative text.</p>
</div></div><div class="section" id="considering-assistive-technologies-and-input-devices"><h2>Considering
assistive technologies and input devices</h2>
<p>Modern data visualizations may contain functional capabilities such
as the ability to hover, click, select, drag, or perform some analytical
tasks over the elements of the visualization space&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Satyanarayan2017VegaLite">[<a href="#ref-Satyanarayan2017VegaLite" id="Satyanarayan2017VegaLite11" aria-label="31, A. Satyanarayan" title="31, A. Satyanarayan" role="doc-noteref">31</a>]</span>.
Virtually all of these analytical capabilities are designed for use with
a mouse.</p>
<p>Input device consideration can roughly be organized as either
<em>pointer-based</em> (such as a mouse or direct touch) or
<em>non-pointer based</em> (which may employ speech recognition or
sequential, discrete navigation such as with a keyboard). Assistive
pointer-based devices, such as a head-mounted touch stylus, can
typically perform any actions that a mouse can and are therefore served
by current interactive visualizations. However, assistive non-pointer
devices, such as a tongue, foot, or breath-operated switch, are not.</p>
<p>By only providing pointer-based interactivity, modern interactive
visualizations exclude users who leverage non-pointer based input, who
are most commonly people with motor and dexterity disabilities. And
unfortunately, there is a complete lack of engagement with these
populations in the data visualization research community&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Marriott2021Inclusive">[<a href="#ref-Marriott2021Inclusive" id="Marriott2021Inclusive11" aria-label="27, K. Marriott et al." title="27, K. Marriott et al." role="doc-noteref">27</a>]</span>.</p>

pseudo-treelike and direct structure types are all valuable to users in
different contexts and with different considerations. Our system must be
able to work with all of these as well as less frequently-used
structures (spatial, relational, geographic, graph, and
diagrammatic).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robust input handling</strong>: Blind and low vision
users may use combinations of different assistive technologies, such as
magnifiers, voice interfaces, and screen readers. Users with motor
impairments may rely on voice, gesture, eye-tracking, keyboard-interface
peripherals (like sip-and-puffs or switches), or fabricated devices.
Both the developer and user should therefore be able to leverage and
customize a broad range of input types, including the above as well as
fabricated, adaptive, and future input modalities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flexible rendering and semantics</strong>: Visuals may or
may not be necessary to render to demonstrate Data Navigator’s
structure. In addition, much of the latest research has shown that
different screen reader users may prefer different orders of information
and at different levels of verbosity. In addition, the context of tasks
the user is performing as well as the nature of the data itself may
influence the design of semantic descriptions and visual indications for
elements. Data Navigator must provide a high degree of flexibility and
control.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To help bridge the gaps between research and standards knowledge
about best practices and building an effective toolkit for
practitioners, we intend for Data Navigator to provide both
<em>exploratory support</em> and <em>vocabulary
correspondence</em>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Maayan2020Domain">[<a href="#ref-Maayan2020Domain" id="Maayan2020Domain01" aria-label="26, D. Ma’ayan" title="26, D. Ma’ayan" role="doc-noteref">26</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In particular, our ideal users are developers who specify data
visualizations using code. To that aim, we intend to provide
<em>exploratory support</em> through generic, dynamic, and flexible
system design decisions. Our system is expressive and customizable,
which encourages exploration of different options.</p>
<p>And we also want the API to include properties that have conceptual
and <em>vocabulary correspondence</em> to our design considerations.
Each design consideration (<em>Structure</em>, <em>Input</em>, and
<em>Rendering</em>) are separately composable, modular subsystems of
Data Navigator that can be used independently or in tandem with one
another.</p>
<p>In this paper we present an implementation of our system using
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on the web. The demonstration of our system is
best suited to the web due to the nature of existing, accessible
building blocks (HTML), which resolve many of the semantic complexities
and logic involved in enabling screen readers to programmatically
navigate and announce meaningful information to users. In addition, many
existing visualization toolkits target the web as an output platform and
we believe that this is the best starting point for adoption and use of
Data Navigator. However, this system design could be implemented as a
toolkit in other environments with proper consideration for input device
handling and screen reader semantics.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-trees-towards-an-accessibility-graph">Beyond trees:
towards an accessibility <em>graph</em></h3>
<p>The first major contribution in the design of Data Navigator is to
use node-edge data as the substrate for our navigation system.</p>
<p>The most important argument in favor of using a graph-based approach
is that a graph can construct virtually any other data structure type
(see <a href="#Figure2" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="existing">Figure 2</a>), including list, table, tree,
spatial, geographic, and diagrammatic structures. Graphs are generic,
which enables them to represent structures both in current and future
interface practices&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Gansner2000Open">[<a href="#ref-Gansner2000Open" id="Gansner2000Open01" aria-label="12, E. R. Gansner and S. C. North" title="12, E. R. Gansner and S. C. North" role="doc-noteref">12</a>]</span>.</p>

The graph representation shows a start, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, and a repeating symbol. Connected to Alabama are example neighboring nodes, each listed once: Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida.">

advancements in accessible data navigation used node-edge diagrams to
demonstrate their tree-like structures&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Zong2022Rich Thompson2023Chart">[<a href="#ref-Zong2022Rich" id="Zong2022Rich71" aria-label="47, J. Zong" title="47, J.

<a href="#Figure10" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="vega-lite">Figure 10</a>. This is because trees are a
form of node-edge graph, but with a root, siblings, parents, and
children as sub-types of nodes that generally have rules for how they
relate to one another.</p>
<p>Node-edge graph structures prioritize direct relationships. Examples
of common direct relationships in visualization are boundaries on maps
(see <a href="#Figure3" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="map">Figure 3</a>), flows and cycles, data with multiple
high level tree structures pointing to the same child datasets (such as
<em>Olli</em> in <a href="#Figure2" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="existing">Figure 2</a>), or even just in diagrammatic,
graph-based visualizations.</p>
<p>A graph structure allows for direct access between information
elements that are not just part of the input data or 1:1 rendered
elements, but may also have perceptual or human-attributed meaning.
Examples of this might include semantic or task-based relationships,
such as navigating to annotations or callouts, between visual-analytic
features like trends, comparisons, or outliers. Spatial layouts such as
intersections of sets or parallel vectors (see <a href="#section:codesign" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="section:codesign">[section:codesign]</a>), or even
relationships to information outside of a visualization and back into it
(like in <a href="#Figure7" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="semantics">Figure 7</a>) are enabled by a graph
structure.</p>
<h3 id="graph-structures-are-more-computationally-efficient">Graph
structures are more computationally efficient</h3>
<p>Data visualizations often portray information that becomes difficult
to handle when using trees and lists. The distance users must travel
between relational elements is significant in lists while redundancy
when navigating relational elements in trees can be problematic.</p>
<p>As an example of this, often a data table or list of locations are
used in conjunction to a map, such as listing all 50 states
alphabetically along with relevant information. The list itself is
expensive to navigate and may not provide any relationship information
about which states border others, let alone ways to easily and directly
access those states.</p>
<p>Part of the visual design justification of using a map instead of a
table is for sighted individuals to understand how geospatial
information may interact with a given variable. The spatial
relationships matter. But when supplementing the list of states with
sub-lists for each state’s bordering states (see <a href="#Figure3" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="map">Figure 3</a>), it
produces redundancy in the rendered result. The rendered data contains
circular connections between nodes but must render every reference,
producing a computational resource creep and cluttered user experience
that can be difficult to exit.</p>

instances and generic edges</h3>

<figcaption>Figure 4: An example of how a single edge instance
references a navigation rule and can even have multiple navigation
rules. A navigation rule can be referenced by multiple
edges.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In Data Navigator, nodes are <em>objects</em> that always contain a
set of edges, where each edge contains a minimum of 4 pieces of
information: a unique identifier, a source, a target, and navigation
rules. These properties are only accessed when a navigation event occurs
on a node with an edge that contains a reference to a rule for that
navigation event. Navigation rules may be unique to an edge instance or
shared among other edge instances.</p>
<p>The source and target properties of edges are either ids that
reference node instances (see <a href="#Figure4" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="simple_movement">Figure 4</a>) or
<em>functions</em> (see <a href="#Figure5" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="dynamic_movement">Figure 5</a>). Because some
edges in a graph may be directed or not, non-directed graphs can use
source and target properties to arbitrarily refer to either node
attached to an edge.</p>
<p>Generic functions for source or target properties can link nodes to
other nodes based on changing content, structure, or behavior that may
be difficult or impossible to determine before a user navigates the
structure.</p>
<p>Function calling also allows some edges to be <em>purely</em>
generic. An example of a reasonable use case of a purely generic edge is
in <a href="#Figure5" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="dynamic_movement">Figure 5</a>, where the
source is a function which returns the present node and the target is
whichever node the user was on previously. This single edge may then be
part of every node’s set of edges, enabling users to have a simple
<em>undo</em> navigation control without creating an <em>undo</em> edge
unique to every source node.</p>
<p>Using this pattern, it is possible to have fully navigable structures
using only generic edges.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 6: An example navigation rule to move “left”
can be called as a method by an event from any input modality. Some
examples include common modalities such as touch swiping
(A) or speaking “left” (B). This also
includes advanced or future modalities such as gesture recognition
(C) or touch-activated, fabricated interfaces
(D).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Navigation rules in Data Navigator (see <a href="#Figure4" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="simple_movement">Figure 4</a> and <a href="#Figure5" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="dynamic_movement">Figure 5</a>) are created
alongside the node-edge structure. Edges reference rules for navigation.
However, these rules are generic and agnostic to the specifics of input
modalities and can be invoked as methods by virtually any detected user
input event (see <a href="#Figure6" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="inputs">Figure 6</a>).</p>
<p>Navigation rules are objects with a unique name, ideally as a noun or
verb in natural language that refers to a direction or location, a
movement direction (a binary used to determine moving towards the source
or target of an edge), and optionally any known user inputs that
activate that navigation, such as a keyboard keypress event name.</p>
<p>It is important for a system to abstract navigation events so that
inputs can be uncoupled from the logic of Data Navigator. This allows
higher level software or hardware logic to handle input validation while
Data Navigator is just responsible for acting on validated input.</p>
<p>Later in our first case example (<a href="#section:raster" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="section:raster">[section:raster]</a>), we demonstrate an
application that handles screen reader, keyboard, mouse and touch
(pointer) swiping, hand gestures, typed text, and speech recognition
input. Abstract navigation namespaces can be called by any of these
input methods.</p>
<p>Additionally, since navigation rules are flexible, end users can also
supply their own key-bind remapping preferences or input validation
rules if developers provide them with an interface.</p>
<p>Because calling a navigation method is abstract, users can even
supply events from their own input modalities as long they have access
to either a text input interface or access to Data Navigator’s
navigation methods. Our demonstration material (in <a href="#section:raster" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="section:raster">[section:raster]</a>) also includes
handling for DIY fabricated interfaces, which are important in
accessibility maker spaces. We chose a produce-based interface&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Rogers2014">[<a href="#ref-Rogers2014" id="Rogers201411" aria-label="29, Y. Rogers" title="29, Y. Rogers" role="doc-noteref">29</a>]</span>, since it was an easy
and low cost proof of concept.</p>
<p>We believe that enabling agnostic input provides a rich space for
future research projects. In addition, browser addons and assistive
technologies could both leverage this flexible interface for end
users.</p>
<h3 id="discrete-sequential-input-opens-new-avenues">Discrete,
sequential input opens new avenues</h3>
<p>The <em>keyboard interface</em> is considered foundational for many
assistive devices, which leverage this technology for discrete,
sequential, non-pointer navigation and interaction&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="WAI2017Keyboard">[<a href="#ref-WAI2017Keyboard" id="WAI2017Keyboard01" aria-label="41, WAI" title="41, WAI" role="doc-noteref">41</a>]</span>. Desktop screen
readers are the most common example of an assistive technology device
that leverages the keyboard interface, however single or limited button
switches, sip-and-puff devices, on-screen keyboards, and many
refreshable braille displays do as well. Support for the keyboard
interface by default in turn provides all discrete, sequential input
devices with access as well.</p>
<p>However by basing Data Navigator’s foundational infrastructure on a
keyboard-like modality, this also provides designers and developers new
avenues to imagine how existing direct, pointer-based, or continuous
inputs can map to discrete, sequential navigation experiences.</p>
<p>For example, with mobile screen readers this already happens: screen
reader users swipe and tap on their screen to sequentially navigate, but
the exact pixel locations of their swiping and tapping generally does
not matter. Their current focus position is discrete and determined by
the screen reader software.</p>
<p>Data Navigator therefore allows for many new possibilities. One
possibility is that sighted mouse and touch users may now also swipe
their way through dense plots or use small interfaces (such as on mobile
devices) that may otherwise be too hard to precisely tap. Data Navigator
optionally removes the accessibility barriers sometimes posed by
precision-based input in visualizations.</p>
<p>Data Navigator does not have to be in conflict with precision-based
input, either. A discrete, sequential navigation infrastructure can be
used in tandem with precision-based pointer events as well as instant
access when coupled with voice commands and search features.</p>

other areas in an application. Alabama has a child node “Counties” which

return.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Nodes in Data Navigator are semantically flexible. This is because
the marks in a data visualization may represent many things, that are
either dependent on the data or the user interface materials.</p>
<p>Since our toolkit implementation is in JavaScript and HTML, our map
example from <a href="#Figure3" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="map">Figure 3</a> might use image semantics for states,
alongside a description of the data relevant to that node. However since
semantics are flexible in this way, Data Navigator could also be used to
integrate into a larger ecosystem, with nodes rendered as hyperlinks to
tables or other elements such as in <a href="#Figure7" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="semantics">Figure 7</a>.</p>
<p>The concept of using node-edge graphs can even extend to have “nodes”
that are entirely different parts of a document or tool, as well as
integrated into the explicit structure provided by Data Navigator. In
some accessibility toolkits, nodes are geometries without functional
semantics&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Satyanarayan2017VegaLite">[<a href="#ref-Satyanarayan2017VegaLite" id="Satyanarayan2017VegaLite21" aria-label="31, A. Satyanarayan" title="31, A. Satyanarayan" role="doc-noteref">31</a>]</span> or list items nested

But in Data Navigator, nodes can semantically be buttons, links, or any
HTML element. Interactive data visualizations sometimes demand more
flexible node semantics than geometries or lists.</p>

</figure>
<p>One of the most significant technical limitations of existing data
visualization toolkits with regards to accessibility is that they rely
on visual substrate, or visual materials, in order to produce data
visualizations. In the case of static, raster images such as png files
or WebGL and canvas elements on the web, there are no interface
properties at all exposed to screen readers for programmatic exploration
and interaction.</p>
<p>If raster images are used, they generally cannot be changed after
rendering. However, according to web accessibility standards, elements
must have a visual indicator provided when focused&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="WAI2016Focus">[<a href="#ref-WAI2016Focus" id="WAI2016Focus01" aria-label="42, WAI" title="42, WAI" role="doc-noteref">42</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Since Data Navigator navigates using focus, an indicator must be
rendered alongside the node semantics. But <em>what</em> is focused
visually and <em>where</em> it is depends on different design needs.</p>
<p>In <em>Visa Chart Components</em>, chart elements can be
<em>selected</em>, so the focus indication is visible over the existing
elements in the chart space. The design choice to have interactive
visual elements located within a chart or graph is also common in other
toolkits that provide accessible focus indication, such as
<em>Highcharts</em>, <em>PowerBI</em>, and <em>SAS Graphics
Accelerator</em>.</p>
<p>However, some visualization toolkits create accessible structures
entirely uncoupled from visual space&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Blanco2022olli">[<a href="#ref-Blanco2022olli" id="Blanco2022olli11" aria-label="1, M. Blanco" title="1, M. Blanco" role="doc-noteref">1</a>]</span>, so focus indication is provided
beneath or beside the chart, not over it.</p>
<p>Due to the different ways that accessibility might be provided, Data
Navigator enables developers to have complete control over the rendering
of which focus elements they want, in what styling, and where. This can
accommodate both un-coupled and visually-coupled approaches to focusing
and more.</p>
<p>Data Navigator’s focus is <em>uncoupled</em> by default and may even
be used independent of any existing graphics at all. Rendering
information may be passed to Data Navigator for it to render (like in <a href="#Figure8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="path">Figure 8</a>) or developers can provide their own
rendered elements and simply use Data Navigator to move between
them.</p>
<p>Because of Data Navigator’s approach to rendering focusable elements,
designers and developers can provide fully customized annotations,
graphics, text, or marks that may not be not part of the original visual
space or elements. One example of this might be adding an outlined path
to a collective cross-stack group of bars in a stacked bar chart (see <a href="#Figure8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="path">Figure 8</a>).</p>
<p>Loose-coupling in this way provides robust flexibility to designers
and developers to handle navigation paths and stories through a data
visualization, even in bespoke or hand-crafted ways.</p>
<h3 id="on-demand-node-rendering-is-efficient">On-demand node rendering
is efficient</h3>
<p>Practitioners care about performance and so do users. Practitioner
toolkits often focus on lazy-loading techniques where accessibility
elements are rendered on-demand rather than all in-memory up front&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Elavsky2021Method Zong2022Rich Blanco2022olli">[<a href="#ref-Elavsky2021Method" id="Elavsky2021Method01" aria-label="10, F.

<p>Data Navigator’s nodes are rendered <em>on-demand</em> by default.
Data Navigator only renders the node that is about to be focused by the
user and after it is focused, the previously focused node is deleted
from memory. This technique has advantages in cases where datasets are
large or users have lower computational bandwidth available. However,
there are cases where practitioners may want to render all of Data
Navigator’s structure in memory, such as server-side rendering or
equivalent. Pre-rendering may be optionally enabled.</p>

robust data navigation handling out of the box for screen reader,

<p>We chose a schema design that arranged the <em>contests</em> to be
navigable across one dimension of movement (<em>up</em> and
<em>down</em>) while the <em>teams</em> are navigable across a
perpendicular dimension of movement (<em>left</em> and <em>right</em>).
This 2-axis style of navigation is used by <em>Highcharts</em> (when
rendering as SVG) and <em>Visa Chart Components</em>. We also chose
these directions because it is coincidental that their visual affordance
is closely coupled with the navigation design (the x axis is ordered
<em>left</em> to <em>right</em> and since the bars are stacked,
<em>up</em> and <em>down</em> can move within the stack). These
directions can also be applied to the axis categories and legend
categories as well, moving <em>left</em> and <em>right</em> across the
entire <em>team’s</em> stacks or up and down across the entire
<em>contest’s</em> groupings.</p>
<p>Using a keyboard, a user might enter this schema and navigate to the
legend, where they could press <em>Enter</em> to then focus the legend’s
first child, pictured in <a href="#Figure8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="path">Figure 8</a>. Pressing up or down navigates in a
circular fashion among the <em>contest</em> groupings. Pressing
<em>Enter</em> again then focuses the first child element of that
<em>contest</em>, all of which are in the <em>Arsenal</em> group, since
it is the first group along the x axis. A user can then navigate <em>up,
down, left,</em> and <em>right</em> among children. Pressing <em>L
Key</em> moves the user back up towards the contest while pressing
<em>Backspace</em> moves the user up towards the x axis. The x axis and
<em>team</em> groupings represent the second tree which intersects the
first (the <em>contests</em>).</p>
<p>Our first case example includes handling for additional input
modalities beyond screen readers and keyboards, including a hand gesture
recognition model, swipe-based touch navigation, and text input (which
can be controlled using voice recognition software).</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>Our first case example demonstrates several of the most important
capabilities of Data Navigator, namely that practitioners can add
accessible navigation to previously inaccessible, static, raster image
formats and that a wide variety of input modalities are supported
easily.</p>
<p>Widely-used toolkits like <em>Vega-Lite</em>, <em>Highcharts</em>,
and <em>D3</em>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Bostock2011D3">[<a href="#ref-Bostock2011D3" id="Bostock2011D301" aria-label="2, M. Bostock" title="2, M. Bostock" role="doc-noteref">2</a>]</span> allow practitioners to choose SVG and
canvas-based rendering methods. Data Navigator’s affordances help
overcome the lack of semantic structure in canvas-based rendering,
allowing developers to take advantage of its processing and memory
efficiency.</p>
<p>Notably in addition to these capabilities, the visual focus
highlighting added was entirely bespoke (as in&nbsp;<a href="#Figure8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="path">Figure 8</a>) and the
navigation paths through the visual were based on our design intentions,
not an extracted view or underlying architecture such as render order.
This demonstrates that our system provides a significant degree of
freedom and control for designers and developers.</p>
<p>As a final discussion point, the resulting visualization contains no
automatically detectable accessibility conformance failures according to
the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative’s accessibility evaluation tool,

<figcaption>Figure 10: A. Various charts from
Vega-Lite share the same general structures with each other

replicated the existing SVG navigation pattern (C) but
used a canvas-based rendering for the visualization. E.
We also improved the navigation scheme to nest marks within a mark group
to allow users to skip them, if needed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our second case example, shown in <a href="#Figure10" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="vega-lite">Figure 10</a>, builds on
<em>Vega-Lite</em>. As shown in <a href="#Figure2" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="existing">Figure 2</a>,
<em>Vega-Lite</em> offers basic screen reader navigation but provides no
navigation at all when rendered using canvas.</p>
<p>While it might be a tedious design choice to allow every mark in a
visualization to be serially accessible to screen reader users, we
nevertheless set out to build a generic ingestion function that would
take a <em>Vega-Lite View</em> object and deterministically recreate
their existing SVG navigation structure in Data Navigator. This way
users would have the same experience between SVG rendered charts and all
current and future rendering options that <em>Vega-Lite</em> offers to
developers.</p>
<p>Notably, <em>Vega-Lite</em> does not explicitly manipulate the
navigation order at all when rendering with SVG. ARIA is simply provided
to allow screen reader users to access each mark in the visualization in
the order the mark appears in the DOM (which is the order it was
rendered). The legend appears after the marks in our schema for this
reason because <em>Vega-Lite</em> renders the legend after marks. This
choice of ordering is for visual reasons: z-axis placement is currently
based on render order in SVG and <em>Vega-Lite</em> wants their legend
visually on top of the rendered marks.</p>
<p>In addition to mimicking their existing SVG navigation strategy, we
also created a way to nest all of the marks within a group so that users
can skip past them and drill in on-demand, which is a valuable pattern
when dealing with situations where providing a mark-level fidelity of
information may not be relevant to a user’s needs by default&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Shneiderman2003Eyes Zong2022Rich">[<a href="#ref-Shneiderman2003Eyes" id="Shneiderman2003Eyes01" aria-label="32, B.

<p>In order to deterministically supply Data Navigator with accurate
information about any given <em>Vega-Lite</em> visualization, we built 3
functions: one that takes a <em>Vega-Lite View</em> as input and
extracts meaningful nodes, one that produces edges based on those nodes,
and one to describe our nodes in a meaningful way for screen reader
users. These generic functions technically work on all existing
<em>Vega-Lite</em> charts, however some are more useful out of the box
than others due to the type of marks involved.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-1">Discussion</h3>
<p>This case example demonstrates that ecosystem-level remediation and
customization is not only possible for toolkit builders but Data
Navigator offers robust potential. Data Navigator’s structure, input,
and rendering capabilities are all flexible and can be adjusted to suit
the needs of a specific toolkit’s design and intended use.</p>
<p>Many visualization libraries may not even provide screen reader
accessible SVG using ARIA-based approaches but do have a consistent
underlying architectural pattern. Some libraries have a consistent
method for converting data into visual formats, readable text labels,
and interaction logic. Strong contenders would be visualization
libraries popular in online, web-based data science notebooks like
<em>ggplot2</em> in R or <em>matplotlib</em> for Python, which typically
only render rasterized pngs or semanticless SVG.</p>
<p>Toolkits with consistent underlying architecture would allow toolkit
developers, not just developers who <em>use</em> toolkits, to remediate
and customize their navigation accessibility using a generic
approach.</p>
<p>Enabling accessibility at the toolkit level allows all downstream use
of that tool to have better defaults, options, and resources available
for building more accessible outcomes for end users.</p>
<p>Many libraries and toolkits provide users with a level of functional
defaults and abstract conciseness so that users don’t have to worry
about low-level geometric considerations&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Satyanarayan2017VegaLite">[<a href="#ref-Satyanarayan2017VegaLite" id="Satyanarayan2017VegaLite31" aria-label="31, A. Satyanarayan" title="31, A. Satyanarayan" role="doc-noteref">31</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Data Navigator allows toolkits developers to also provide their users
with abstractions and defaults for accessibility that make sense for
their ecosystem.</p>
<p>Despite our schema recreating a screen reader experience based on SVG
(and improving it), Data Navigator’s additional features also apply:
users are able to leverage a much wider array of input modalities.</p>
<p><em>Vega-Lite</em> provides many ways to make marks clickable and
even perform complex actions using mouse-based input. While Data
Navigator does not engage accessible brush and drag-based inputs, it
does provide keyboard-only access by default, which can be used to make
events previously only accessible to mouse clicking available to many
other technologies. This is an improvement over <em>Vega-Lite</em>’s SVG
+ ARIA rendering option.</p>
<p>When measuring performance across test datasets containing 406 and
20,300 data points in a scatter plot, Data Navigator increases
initialization time by <span class="math inline">∼</span>0.45 to <span class="math inline">∼</span>1.5ms respectively. Our extraction functions
specific to <em>Vega-Lite</em> increase initialization between <span class="math inline">∼</span>4.8 and <span class="math inline">∼</span>8.5ms respectively. Given that our benchmark
testing for <em>Vega-Lite’s</em> SVG rendering initialized in <span class="math inline">∼</span>1,800ms for 20,300 data points and canvas in
<span class="math inline">∼</span>700ms, we do not anticipate that Data
Navigator will have a negative impact on performance in most
visualization contexts.</p>

<p>However many visualization experiences may be authored in smaller
scales, with fewer designers, and less time such as the development of a
prototype or demonstration of an emerging idea. In practical or industry
contexts, co-design sessions (and design sessions in general) may be
much shorter. The goal of these co-design sessions is simply to create
an artifact with the artifact’s intended users.</p>
<p>Since our paper is contribution towards practical outcomes, we
simulated a light co-design session with the aim of producing
low-fidelity prototypes of novel data interaction patterns.</p>

<p>Authors Frank Elavsky (sighted) and Lucas Nadolskis (blind) set out
with the goal of developing screen-reader friendly prototypes that can
explore geometric and mathematical models produced by the math
diagramming tool <em>Penrose</em>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Ye2020Penrose">[<a href="#ref-Ye2020Penrose" id="Ye2020Penrose01" aria-label="46, K. Ye et al." title="46, K. Ye et al." role="doc-noteref">46</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Nadolskis is a neuroscience engineer who is a native screen reader
user and uses both mathematical concepts as well as data-related tasks
in his research. Elavsky proposed a series of possible math-based
visualization types produced by <em>Penrose</em> to build prototypes
for, and Nadolskis selected <em>set</em> and <em>vector</em> diagrams as
the two worth exploring first. The justification for this selection is
that understanding these two concepts is important for work in data
science, programming, and more advanced math concepts.</p>
<p>In particular we grounded the context of our contribution in a
hypothetical classroom setting, where a screen reader user who is a
student will have access to the equations in both raw text and
<em>MathJax</em>. We want to provide an experience that does not replace
the existing resources screen reader users have to learn in classrooms
but rather supplement.</p>
<p>At our disposal for our co-design session was a <em>Dot
Pad</em>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Dot2020Dot">[<a href="#ref-Dot2020Dot" id="Dot2020Dot01" aria-label="6, Dot Pad inc." title="6, Dot Pad inc." role="doc-noteref">6</a>]</span>, which
is a refreshable tactile braille display. Our <em>Dot Pad</em> enabled
Elavsky to produce something visual and then translate it into the
display for Nadolskis. Similar to de Greef <span>et&nbsp;al</span>&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="deGreef2021Interdependent">[<a href="#ref-deGreef2021Interdependent" id="deGreef2021Interdependent01" aria-label="5, L. de Greef" title="5, L. de Greef" role="doc-noteref">5</a>]</span>, we used
a tactile interface as an intermediary to help us get a shared sense of
the meaningful spatial features of our figures.</p>
<p>Elavsky started with a reference diagram and then traced a wide
variety of every possible node that might be worth navigating to in the
diagram (see <a href="#Figure11" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="braille">Figure 11</a>).</p>
<p>We selected which nodes were most important in each diagram, how to
navigate between them, and how we wanted to render their visuals and
semantics.</p>
<p>The selection of our problem space, scope of solutions, context of
contribution, general discussion, and preparation of materials took
approximately 12 hours of work over 2 weeks. The exploration of our
prototype design space for our 2 prototypes took 1 hour. Building the
prototypes took 2 hours.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 12: A. A reference image

</figure>
<p>Our first prototype was a set diagram (see&nbsp;<a href="#Figure12" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="sets">Figure 12</a>). For our
structure, we decided that it has 3 important semantic levels: the high
level, the inclusion level, and the exclusion level. The inclusion level
is first and the siblings are all sets or subsets that include other
sets. The exclusion level is beneath and contains sets or subsets that
are exclusive to the sets they belong to, which are accessed by drilling
down from a set.</p>
<p>Our schema design starts with a user encountering the root level (1)
and may optionally drill in to the first child of the next level (2)
using the <em>Enter</em> key. The user may navigate siblings at this
level using <em>right</em> and <em>left</em> directions, but this level
is not circular (like in <a href="#Figure9" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="static">Figure 9</a>) to maintain the spatial
relationships. The user may drill in on either set again to view the
non-intersecting portion of that set. Any node can drill up, towards the
root, using <em>Escape</em> or <em>Backspace</em>.</p>

<p>Our second prototype was a parallel vectors diagram (see&nbsp;<a href="#Figure13" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="vectors">Figure 13</a>). For the structure of this
diagram we created a first level group that contains each vector and
vector sum. The sibling to this grouping is another group which
organizes sub-equations related to calculating each parallel vector. The
sub equations each contain children that pair the sub equation with the
vector it is parallel to.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="#Figure12" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="sets">Figure 12</a>, this figure maintains spatial
relationships along the x dimension, does not have circular navigation,
and allows drilling in and out.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-2">Discussion</h3>
<p>After our co-design sessions, our visual materials and navigation
structures were used in the creation of functional prototypes. We
additionally hand-crafted the descriptions and semantics for each
node.</p>
<p>Accessibility work often takes a long time, from co-design to
building to validation. But we believe that a well-articulated and
useful design space, with tools that provide expressiveness and control
over the dimensions of that design space, can improve how this work is
done. The above case example demonstrates how builders who are thinking
about data navigation design can rapidly scaffold prototypes for use in
Data Navigator.</p>
<p>In particular, Data Navigator’s design as a system gave our co-design
sessions <em>vocabulary correspondence</em>. Data Navigator’s language
helped us focus on the <em>nodes, edges,</em> and <em>navigation
rules</em> for our <em>structure</em> while we also explicitly discussed
the <em>rendering</em> details of <em>coordinates, shapes, styling,</em>
and <em>semantics</em> for each node. The vocabulary of our design space
directly corresponded with code details required to create a functional
prototype.</p>
<p>We note that this co-design work is not intended to contribute a
<em>validated</em> set of designs. Rather, our contribution with this
case example is to demonstrate that within the larger ecosystem of a
research venture, Data Navigator is an improvement over designing and
building navigable structures from scratch.</p>

applied contexts. It is, as Louridas writes, a <em>technical
material</em>: a technology that enables new and useful
capabilities&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Louridas1999Bricolage">[<a href="#ref-Louridas1999Bricolage" id="Louridas1999Bricolage01" aria-label="23, P. Louridas" title="23, P. Louridas" role="doc-noteref">23</a>]</span>. While beyond the scope of
the current paper, a critical next step for future work is to conduct
separate studies with both practitioners and end users to evaluate Data
Navigator’s affordances.</p>
<p>Unlike toolkits that provide an end-to-end development pipeline for
accessible visualization, Data Navigator serves as a low-level building
block or material (like concrete). As such, one potential limitation of
the framework is that it can be used to build both curbs (which are
inaccessible) as well as ramps and <em>curb-cuts</em> (which may be more
broadly accessible).</p>
<p>Even when building more accessible curb-cuts, we stress the
importance of actively involving people with disabilities in the design
and validation of new ideas, in line with prior work&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Reid2022Curb Lundgard2019Sociotechnical Lundgard2022Accessible Zong2022Rich">[<a href="#ref-Reid2022Curb" id="Reid2022Curb01" aria-label="28, B.

For example, while our first two case examples replicate co-designed and
validated existing work, our third case example’s co-designed prototypes
would need to be validated with relevant stakeholders before wider
implementation. Our system does not <em>guarantee</em> any sort of
accessibility on its own.</p>
<p>The diverse array of modalities supported by Data Navigator opens an
immediate line of future work in engaging people with a correspondingly
diverse set of disabilities. While recent explorations into accessible
data visualization have been inspiring, this trend has primarily focused
on the experiences of people with visual disabilities&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Elavsky2022Chartability Marriott2021Inclusive Kim2021Accessible">[<a href="#ref-Elavsky2022Chartability" id="Elavsky2022Chartability31" aria-label="9, F.

More research should be conducted with other populations, particularly
people who leverage assistive technologies beyond screen readers, to
understand how interactive data visualizations can be better designed to
serve them.</p>
<p>Finally, there are significant opportunities to improve the
efficiency of our approach, including developing deterministic and
non-deterministic methods to generate node-edge data and navigation
rules from a visualization. Ma’ayan <span>et&nbsp;al</span> stress in
particular that reducing tedious complexity can contribute to the
success of a well-designed toolkit&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="Maayan2020Domain">[<a href="#ref-Maayan2020Domain" id="Maayan2020Domain11" aria-label="26, D. Ma’ayan" title="26, D. Ma’ayan" role="doc-noteref">26</a>]</span>. Future work should identify areas
where graphical interface tools or higher-level specifications can
improve the experience of working with Data Navigator.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="conclusion"><h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Practitioners at large continue to produce inaccessible interactive
data visualizations, excluding people with disabilities. We believe that
the burden of remediation first starts with the developers who build and
maintain the toolkits that practitioners use.</p>
<p>However, the challenges faced by toolkit builders are significant.
Most toolkits lack an underlying, navigable structure, support for broad
input modalities used by people with disabilities, and meaningful,
semantic rendering.</p>
<p>To engage these limitations we present Data Navigator, a technical
contribution that builds on existing work towards a more generalizable
accessibility-centered toolkit for creating data navigation interfaces.
Data Navigator is designed for use by practitioners who both build and
use existing toolkits and want a tool to make their data visualizations
and interfaces more accessible.</p>
<p>We contribute a high-level system design for our node-edge
graph-based approach that can be used to build data structures that are
navigable by a wide array of assistive technologies and input
modalities. Data Navigator is generic and can scaffold list, tree,
graph, relational, spatial, diagrammatic, and geographic types of data
structures common to data visualization.</p>
<p>Our system is designed to encourage both remediation of existing
inaccessible systems and visualization formats as well as help scaffold
the design of novel, future projects. We look forward to further
research that explores the possibilities enabled by Data Navigator.</p>
