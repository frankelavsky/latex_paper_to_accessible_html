          Novices and experts have struggled to evaluate the accessibility of data visualizations because there are no
          common shared guidelines across environments, platforms, and contexts in which data visualizations are
          authored. Between non-specific standards bodies like WCAG, emerging research, and guidelines from specific
          communities of practice, it is hard to organize knowledge on how to evaluate accessible data visualizations.
          We present Chartability, a set of heuristics synthesized from these various sources which enables designers,
          developers, researchers, and auditors to evaluate data-driven visualizations and interfaces for visual, motor,
          vestibular, neurological, and cognitive accessibility. In this paper, we outline our process of making a set
          of heuristics and accessibility principles for Chartability and highlight key features in the auditing
          process. Working with participants on real projects, we found that data practitioners with a novice level of
          accessibility skills were more confident and found auditing to be easier after using Chartability. Expert
          accessibility practitioners were eager to integrate Chartability into their own work. Reflecting on
          Chartability’s development and the preliminary user evaluation, we discuss tradeoffs of open projects, working
          with high-risk evaluations like auditing projects in the wild, and challenge future research projects at the
          intersection of visualization and accessibility to consider the broad intersections of disabilities.

    </p>
    <p>
      Accessibility is the practice of making information, content, and functionality fully available to and usable by
      people with disabilities. As part of this process, practitioners need to be able to identify accessibility
      barriers. While general accessibility standards help, evaluating the inaccessibility of complex data systems can
      be a daunting and often expensive task. State-of-the art automated compliance checkers only find 57% of
      accessibility errors&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_study_2021"
        >[<a href="#ref-Deque2021Automated" id="noauthor_study_202101" aria-label="28, Deque" title="28, Deque">28</a
        >]</span
      >, meaning accessible experiences must still be manually designed and checked for quality. And following standards
      may only account for up to half of the needs of people with disabilities
      <span class="citation" data-cites="power_2012"
        >[<a href="#ref-Power2012Guidelines" id="power_201201" aria-label="77, C. Power" title="77, C. Power">77</a
        >]</span
      >
      anyway. Additionally, the intended wide applicability of these general standards means they fall short for
      information-rich systems, such as data visualizations (which use size, color, angles, shapes, and other dimensions
      to encode information). These specific contexts, communities, and libraries that deal with data visualizations and
      information-rich interfaces often have their own tools and guidelines for use, but they seldom include
      accessibility. Finally, research at the intersection of data visualization and accessibility has yet to
      meaningfully permeate data visualization tools and communities and primarily focuses on blindness and low vision,
      neglecting diverse accessibility needs of people with other disabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Synthesizing evolving accessibility standards, research findings, and artifacts from communities of practice into
      usable knowledge for a specific, evolving domain is a wicked problem. To address this, we present Chartability.
      Chartability is an accessibility evaluation system specific to data visualizations and interfaces which aims to
      help practitioners answer the question, “how accessible is my data visualization?” Chartability organizes
      knowledge from disparate bodies of work into testable heuristics based on the functional accessibility principles
      POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust)&nbsp;<span

      and 3 novel principles CAF (Compromising, Assistive, and Flexible), which we added to attend to the unique
      qualities and demands of data visualizations. We refer to these 7 heuristic principles as POUR+CAF. Chartability
      is a community-contributed project that leverages the governance strategies of open source projects as a way to
      address the complex dual-evolution of both accessibility and data interaction practices.

      We additionally present an initial, light evaluation of Chartability from the experience of practitioners using
      it. We set out to see if using Chartability reduces the barrier of entry into this work for accessibility novices
      and if accessibility experts had any feedback to share about its use. We gave practitioners introductory material
      for Chartability and instructed them to use it according to their needs. We found that before using Chartability
      only accessibility experts believed auditing data visualizations to be somewhat easy or easy, while the other
      group believed auditing data visualizations to be somewhat hard or hard. All novice accessibility practitioners
      became more confident after using Chartability and believed auditing data visualizations for accessibility to be
      less difficult. Conversely while the expert accessibility practitioners were already confident in their ability to
      evaluate accessibility (and all unanimously had no change in their before and after evaluations), they were
      excited to adopt Chartability into their set of auditing resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work sets out to acknowledge that data practitioners face significant barriers when first making data
      visualizations, systems, and experiences accessible. While Chartability contributes to filling gaps and organizing
      knowledge, it also challenges visualization and data interaction researchers to explore new horizons of
      possibilities in this space. As such, we conclude with recommendations for future research at the crossroads of
      data visualization and accessibility.

      While recent works at the intersection of data visualization and accessibility are promising, they do not provide
      a consistent and unified methodology for designers to evaluate the accessibility of their work across the broad
      spectrum of disability considerations.

      when we asked “What do we mean by data visualization accessibility research?” we found that nearly all topics of
      study were vision-related. Largely, access issues other than vision that affect data visualization (such as
      cognitive/neurological, vestibular, and motor concerns) are almost entirely unserved in this research space. Kim
      <span>et&nbsp;al</span> found that 56 papers have been published between 1999 and 2020 that focus on
      vision-related accessibility (not including color vision deficiency), with only 3 being published at a
      visualization venue (and only recently since 2018)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="kim_accessible_2021"

      We also found that there is no research specific to low vision disabilities (not blindness or color vision
      deficiency) unless conflated with screen reader usage in data visualization. Blind and low vision people are often
      researched together, but in practice may use different assistive technologies (such as magnifiers and contrast
      enhancers) and have different interaction practices (such as a combination of sight, magnification, and screen
      reader use)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="szpiro_2016"

      Our research goals are to find what is already being done in data visualization and accessibility and to see if we
      can enhance that activity. To this aim, our background investigation includes a broad and comprehensive
      exploration of the field of practitioner and non-academic artifacts.

      have broad accessibility functionality built in, but their documentation is technically specific to their
      implementation. While these relatively accessible libraries and tools can be helpful for inspiration, their
      specific techniques and guidance materials are not easily transferrable to other environments or applications
      where data visualizations are created. Practitioners must reverse engineer and deconstruct many of the methods
      employed by these libraries, and with the exception of VCC (which is open source), this task requires significant
      effort, given their primarily closed-box nature.

      In common charting tools and libraries (apart from those already mentioned) accessibility engineering is often not
      present, limited in scope, or has only recently become an effort. More established visualization libraries like
      matplotlib, ggplot2, d3js, R-Shiny, and Plotly have left most accessibility efforts to developers, with varying
      levels of documentation and difficulty involved&nbsp;<span

      Many community-driven efforts are under-utilized, must be discovered outside of the primary environment’s
      ecosystem, have poor or no core, internal support, and are inconsistently and partially implemented. Accessibility
      is still an afterthought in data visualization and ad-hoc, specific solutions proposed have not led to widespread

      To summarize the complex problem space to which this paper contributes: Research in data visualization primarily
      focuses on visual accessibility, accessibility standards focus on a broad range of disabilities but lack deep
      contextualization for data visualization, and practitioners seem to build a wide array of solutions to fill these
      gaps, most of which are poorly maintained or adopted. Any time a practitioner wants to embark on a journey
      learning how to evaluate the accessibility of a data visualization, they must collect and synthesize this complex
      space of knowledge themselves. We have included (with permission) an exemplary field artifact as an example of
      this type of labor in our supplemental materials, which contributed to the United States Government’s project,

      deliver useful but flexible knowledge. Heuristic evaluation models have a long history in HCI and are cheap to use
      and require little expertise. They have been shown to be effective methods for practitioners compared to user
      testing, focus groups, or other evaluative methods that require existing expert knowledge or recruitment,

          involved in ensuring I was effectively following accessibility standards while also attending to the complex
          design considerations of data visualizations. To improve this work both for myself and others in the future, I
          surveyed existing problems and challenges others faced and selected a solution that I felt equipped to
          address.

          <strong>Collect Existing Resources</strong>: I set out to answer, “If evaluating the accessibility of data
          experiences is hard, what do existing standards miss?” I evaluated my seed knowledge (WCAG criteria) for
          shortcomings and gaps and collected other data relevant to my goal (academic and industry research,
          open-source libraries, tools, applications, data products, government guidelines, design guidelines, software
          documentation, university coursework, and practitioner articles).

          <strong>Code Resources</strong>: After collating these resources (including relevant WCAG criteria), I loosely
          borrowed from thematic analysis&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="braun_clarke_thematic_2006"

          and qualitatively coded this data. I developed a set of 29 codes starting with WCAG’s POUR principles and
          expanded the codes to account for other concerns that came up in the resources, including what type of
          accessibility was being addressed (e.g., cognitive, visual), whether a solution was technology-specific or
          agnostic, and other categories (like “time-consuming” or “user-controlled”). I then divided the resources into
          codable segments with relatively distinct pieces of information and applied the 29 codes to the information
          segments. I grouped information with codes in common, resulting in a representative 45 groups of related
          information segments.

          <strong>Synthesize Heuristics</strong>: Since auditing depends on measurable heuristics, I adjusted each of
          the 45 groupings that resulted from the qualitative analysis into phrasing that could be verified by an
          evaluation. I then augmented each heuristic with known testing procedures, resources, and tools necessary for
          applying them in practice. 10 critical heuristics (these were determined top priorities through user feedback)
          are previewed in <a href="#tab:table" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="tab:table">Table 1</a>,

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Group Heuristics into Higher-level Principles</strong>: I linked each heuristic with relevant web
          accessibility standards and POUR principles to draw a familiar connection for users who might already be
          accessibility practitioners. 26 heuristics fit neatly back into Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, or
          Robust.

        <p>
          <strong>Develop Remaining Themes into New Principles</strong>: 19 remaining heuristics with complex codes and
          overlapping groups demanded new theorizing, as they either did not fit into POUR at all or could arguably
          belong to multiple principles at once. I analyzed these remaining complex heuristics and for similarities and
          organized them under 3 new themes, which we are contributing as new accessibility principles, Compromising,
          Assistive, and Flexible, defined below.

    <h2 id="compromising">Compromising</h2>
    <p>
      Compromising is a principle that focuses on Understandable, yet Robust heuristics. These heuristics are based on
      providing alternative, transparent, tolerant, information flows with consideration for different ways that users
      of assistive technologies and users with disabilities need to consume information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compromising challenges designs that only allow access to information through limited or few interfaces or
      processes. These heuristics focus on providing information at a low and high level (such as tables and summaries),
      transparency about the state of complex interactions, error tolerance, and that data structures can be navigated
      according to their presentation. Compromising designs have both information and system redundancies in place.
    </p>
    <h2 id="assistive">Assistive</h2>
    <p>
      Assistive is a principle that primarily builds off the intersection of Understandable and Perceivable principles
      but focuses on the labor involved in access. These heuristics include categories that encourage data interfaces to
      be intelligent and multi-sensory in a way that reduces the cognitive and functional labor required of the user as
      much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Assistive principle focuses on what Swan <span>et&nbsp;al</span> refer to as “adding value”&nbsp;<span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="noauthor_inclusive_nodate"
        >[<a href="#ref-SwanInclusive" id="noauthor_inclusive_nodate01" aria-label="93, H. Swan" title="93, H. Swan"

      >. We visualize because it is faster and more efficient than munging cell at a time through data. Assistive
      heuristics ensure that both visual and non-visual data representations add value for people with disabilities.
    </p>
    <h2 id="flexible">Flexible</h2>
    <p>
      Contrasted with Compromising (which focuses on robust understanding), flexible heuristics focus on robust user
      agency and the ability to adjust the Perceivable and Operable traits of a data experience. Flexible heuristics all
      have a tight coupling between a data experience and the larger technological context the user inhabits. The
      preferences that a user sets in lower-level systems must be respected in higher level environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-advocacy and interdependent agency are important sociotechnical considerations that engage the conflicting
      access needs that different users might have in complex technological interactions like data
      experiences&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="bennett_interdependence_2018 mankoff_disability_2010"

      While a highly trained auditor may be able to casually evaluate an artifact in as little as 30 minutes or even
      hold heuristics in mind as they are doing their own creative work, those new to auditing may take anywhere between
      2 and 8 hours to complete a full pass of Chartability. Professional audits, which can take weeks or months, often
      include multiple auditors and provide rigorous documentation and detailed recommendations for remediation,
      typically in the form of a report. Chartability is meant to serve both quick pass and deep dive styles of audits,
      so users are expected to leverage it as they see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below we give an example of what might be a quick pass audit, using Chartability. Which principles are applied in
      each of these stages are listed in parentheses in each heading.

    <figure>

      <figcaption>
        Figure 1: A low contrast chart (left) compared to a higher contrast version (right). A dropper tool is
        extracting the fill color of the bar and then a contrast ratio has been calculated. Note that the fill color is
        the same on both bars, but darker borders have been added to ensure the visualization passes contrast tests.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Checking for contrast is the most common critical failure; 87.5% of tests (7 out of 8) from our user study
      involving this heuristic failed, which supports the WebAim Million Report’s findings (83.9% of the top 1 million
      websites also fail contrast testing, more than any other WCAG criteria)&nbsp;<span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="noauthor_webaim_nodate"
        >[<a href="#ref-WebAIMWebAIM" id="noauthor_webaim_nodate01" aria-label="100, WebAIM" title="100, WebAIM">100</a
        >]</span
      >. In order to evaluate contrast, often a combination of automatic (code-driven) and manual tooling is performed.
      When manually auditing, practitioners typically use a dropper and a contrast calculator (<a
        href="#fig:2"
        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:2"
        >Figure 1</a
      >). Most auditors find this to be one of the easiest tasks to perform and accomplishes 3 different heuristics in
      Chartability: ensuring text/geometries have contrast, interactive states for elements have enough contrast change,
      and the keyboard focus indicator is easy to distinguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceivable heuristics also include tests and tools for color vision deficiency and ensuring that color alone
      isn’t used to communicate meaning (like the redundantly encoded textures in
      <a href="#fig:9" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:9">Figure 8</a>). And another common, critical
      failure from Perceivable is text size. No text should be smaller than 12px/9pt in size.

    <h2 id="keyboard-probing-operable-assistive">Keyboard Probing (Operable, Assistive)</h2>
    <p>
      The next practice that most auditors should become comfortable with is using a keyboard to navigate and operate
      any functionality that is provided. Most assistive technologies, from screen readers to a variety of input devices
      (like switches, joysticks, sip and puffs, etc) use the keyboard api (or keyboard interface) to navigate content.
      If a data interface contains interactive elements (<a
        href="#fig:3"
        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:3"
        >Figure 2</a
      >, <a href="#fig:4" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:4">Figure 3</a>), those elements (or their
      functionality) must be able to be reached and controlled using a keyboard alone. Auditors should be critical of
      how much work is involved in keyboard navigation, especially (<a
        href="#fig:8"
        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:8"
        >Figure 7</a
      >). All that is required to start is the auditor begins pressing the tab key to see if anything interactive comes
      into focus. Arrow keys, spacebar, enter, and escape may be used in some contexts. Generally, instructions or cues
      should always be provided.

        to filter a dataset (on the right). A system alert (red box) notifies the user of their interaction result. This
        selection capability must also be provided for the keyboard interface and the alert must be announced to screen
        readers.
      </figcaption>

    <p>
      Using a keyboard provides an opportunity to evaluate many different heuristics: checking for multiple inputs (<a

        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:4"
        >Figure 3</a

        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:3"

    <p>
      Closely related to keyboard testing is testing with a screen reader. Some things may work with a screen reader
      that do not with a keyboard (and vice versa), so both must be evaluated.

    <p>
      Screen readers, unlike more basic keyboard input devices, read out content that is textual (including non-visual
      textual information like <em>alternative text</em>). Using a screen reader to audit is generally the hardest skill
      to learn. Keeping this in mind, testing whether the meaningful text provided in a visual (such as in
      <a href="#fig:5" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:5">Figure 4</a>) is accessible with a screen
      reader is the easiest and most basic test that auditors should first perform.

      Next, all valuable information and functionality in a data experience should be tested whether it is available to
      a screen reader. This includes the individual variables about a mark as well as whether that mark is interactive
      (<a href="#fig:6" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:6">Figure 5</a>), whether status updates that
      reflect context change provide alerts (<a href="#fig:4" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:4"
        >Figure 3</a
      >), and whether summary textual information is provided about the whole chart (<a

        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:5"
        >Figure 4</a

      Checking Cognitive Barriers (Understandable, Compromising)
    </h2>
    <p>
      First, auditing for cognitive barriers generally involves checking the reading level and clarity of all available
      text using analytical tools. But Chartability also requires that all charts have basic text that provides a
      visually-available textual description and takeaway (<a
        href="#fig:5"
        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:5"
        >Figure 4</a
      >). This alone is one of the most important things to check for. In complex cases where a chart has a visual
      feature with an assumedly obvious takeaway, checking for annotations or textual callouts is important to help
      avoid interpretive issues&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="xiong_curse_2020"

    <p>
      The final series of checks an auditor should make involve thinking about the overall work in a design (as it
      intersects with other considerations) as well as the larger technical context where the user is situated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auditors should first try to change system settings (such as toggling high contrast modes) to see whether a data
      experience respects these settings (<a href="#fig:9" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:9"
        >Figure 8</a
      >), run automatic semantic evaluations as well as manually check for appropriate meaning (<a
        href="#fig:6"
        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:6"
        >Figure 5</a
      >), and check if dense or highly complex visuals have sonified, tactile, or textual summaries available (<a
        href="#fig:8"
        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:8"
        >Figure 7</a
      >). Auditors should also check whether system updates provide clear feedback textually (<a
        href="#fig:4"
        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:4"
        >Figure 3</a
      >) as well as checking if there are both high and low level representations of information available (<a
        href="#fig:7"
        data-reference-type="autoref"
        data-reference="fig:7"

    <p>
      Auditors should be especially critical of static designs, such as those that either use textures by default or not
      (<a href="#fig:9" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:9">Figure 8</a>), which are a high risk of
      compromising and assistive failure.
    </p>
    <h1 id="validating-chartability">Validating Chartability</h1>
    <p>
      Next, Elavsky explains the preliminary user evaluation: I validated whether data practitioners felt more confident
      and equipped to make their own work accessible with Chartability. Additionally, I also wanted to interview expert
      accessibility practitioners (including those with disabilities) with the same questions, to see if Chartability
      had anything to offer in helping them understand and evaluate data experiences better.
    </p>
    <p>
      My secondary goal was to present a tool that can be helpful even in the wild on real projects (with all the weird
      design and engineering quirks that come with that). I wanted Chartability to be usable on things built with a tool
      like Tableau and fully bespoke, hand-coded visualizations, like those made with JavaScript and D3. To this
      secondary aim, I intentionally solicited participants who were working on a variety of different projects, each of
      their own design.
    </p>
    <h2 id="pre-validations-and-flipped-roles-participants-question-me">
      Pre-Validations and Flipped Roles: Participants Question <em>Me</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I performed several early, light validations of my work before soliciting and involving participants formally. My
      early pre-validations #2-4 (below) all focused on practitioners asking me questions and giving feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      My 4 pre-validations happened during the process of making Chartability, as well as introducing short iterations
      back into the making process:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Beta Testing</strong>: I performed several beta tests of Chartability during the process of making. I
          audited using versions that only had POUR principles, tried versions of Chartability that focused only on
          standards, and also tried out different iterations of the heuristics as I was forming them. This testing was
          important to perform early in the process because it helped me test the limits of various possible directions
          for this tool (standards-only, against standards, building off of standards, etc).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Early Advice</strong>: After the first full pass of making Chartability was complete, I sent
          Chartability via email to 4 accessibility experts and 6 interested people with disabilities familiar with
          auditing in order to solicit open feedback.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Professional Workshop</strong>: I held a half-day professional workshop via zoom on auditing
          visualizations for accessibility and presented Chartability’s heuristics to this select audience of 50
          participants. I demonstrated how to audit and then had a chance for feedback and questions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Deep Feedback Session</strong>: I presented Chartability to 14 experts on data visualization and
          accessibility, 5 of which are people with disabilities. I presented in two separate sessions through 2-hour
          video calls on zoom (roughly one hour was demonstration and one hour was discussion).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="sec:critical heuristics">Discovering “Critical” Heuristics</h2>
    <p>
      These pre-validations helped me combine and divide some of the heuristics, adjust the language and phrasing, and
      label 10 specific tests as “Critical,” which can be seen in
      <a href="#tab:table" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="tab:table">Table 1</a>. These critical tests
      were ones that community members stressed as an important priority for one or more of the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>They are prohibitively expensive to fix late.</p></li>
      <li><p>The barriers they produce are too significant to ignore.</p></li>
      <li><p>They are among the most common type of accessibility failure.</p></li>
      <li><p>They affect many parts of a data experience.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>All Critical heuristics are based on standards or research.</p>
    <h2 id="selecting-participants-and-projects">Selecting Participants and Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I was a practitioner and representing myself as a volunteer when I reached out to participants. At this stage in
      the project, I was still not affiliated with a research institution and was not interested in producing
      publishable knowledge. I intended to test Chartability in the wild and validate whether it achieved its aims. My
      priority was to collaborate with folks working on difficult problems or those who had a rare intersection of
      expertise between accessibility standards and interactive data experiences. To this end, I was highly permissive
      with potential collaborators in order to maximize the expertise of participants and breadth of environments for
      testing Chartability.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, part of being permissive with participants meant that I was willing to collaborate on projects that I
      cannot share in a research publication and many of my participants must remain anonymous (including interview
      results that contain sensitive information about intellectual property). Given that auditing is a field of work
      about identifying failures, there was both a high demand for participation in the evaluation of Chartability in
      tension with a low motivation to make these failures known in a public venue.
    </p>
    <p>A summary of our selection process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Solicitation</strong>: I reached out via email to 24 individuals in my network to participate in
          helping to evaluate Chartability. I mentioned that I wanted Chartability to be applied to a current project of
          theirs and was interested in performing some interviews about their experience before and after using
          Chartability. I mentioned up front that working with me would be uncompensated and potentially take multiple
          hours of their time (even multiple sessions) over zoom meetings.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Response</strong>: 16 individuals were interested and shared their project details (2 would require an
          NDA to be signed).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Selection</strong>: I selected 8, based either on the expertise of the individuals, on the robustness
          of their project, and/or on the opportunity to get feedback about Chartability in team environments (which I
          didn’t anticipate, but 3 of the 8 represented team efforts).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Resulting Group</strong>: I worked with 19 total participants across 8 environment spaces.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Publishable Group</strong>: Due to intellectual property concerns, I can publish interview results
          from 6 participants and discuss the details of 4 audit environments.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      full 45) and his dashboard failed 7 of them. A full audit was later conducted on Chris’s behalf. His full audit
      had a total 26 failures, 11 of which were considered non-applicable.<a

    </p>
    <h1 id="study-results">Study Results</h1>
    <p>I asked the 6 participants a series of qualitative and Likert-scale evaluation questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Have you ever performed an audit of a data experience before?</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>What stage of production is your project in? Analysis, design, prototyping, development, maintenance?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          How confident are you in your ability to perform an audit of a data experience for accessibility issues? (1-5,
          1 being not confident at all, 5 being fully confident.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          How difficult do you perceive auditing a data experience for accessibility issues is? (1-5, 1 being trivial, 5
          being very difficult.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (After using Chartability) How confident are you in your ability to perform an audit of a data experience for
          accessibility issues? (1-5, 1 being not confident at all, 5 being fully confident.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (After using Chartability) How difficult do you perceive auditing a data experience for accessibility issues
          is? (1-5, 1 being trivial, 5 being very difficult.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>(After using Chartability) Do you intend to continue using Chartability?</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Each of these questions had an open-ended question attached, “Is there anything else you would like to add?” Every
      participant provided additional input on questions 3 through 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the 3 participants who only consider themselves expert data practitioners had performed an audit before.
      All 3 of them reported that they believed auditing to be easier and that they are more confident in their ability
      to evaluate the accessibility of data experiences after using Chartability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the 3 accessibility experts (all of whom have performed audits of data experiences before), their opinions on
      these measurements were unchanged after using Chartability. All 6 participants noted that they plan to use
      Chartability in their own work and would recommend it to their peers.
    </p>
    <p>Below we overview some of the key insights Elavsky received from the open ended responses.</p>
    <h2 id="real-access-has-more-considerations-than-colorblindness">
      Real Access has more Considerations than Colorblindness
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the data practitioners, DeMartini wrote after his audit, “I have read a lot about color blindness and could
      provide meaningful feedback to visualization developers on that topic, but I have come to realize that
      accessibility is so much more than this and I basically didn’t really know where to start when it came to the true
      scope of accessibility.” He ended his qualitative feedback with, “I think this could be a great tool for the
      masses and really look forward to the impact it can possibly have on the (inaccessible) data visualizations which
      are being created in huge numbers these days.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="audits-are-slow-but-help-me-focus">Audits are Slow, but Help me Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Amber Thomas wrote, “It still takes a while to do a complete audit, but it’s not hard! For someone new to the
      space, all the possible options that can be used to make visualizations more accessible can be overwhelming.
      [Chartability] helped me to focus.” She finished her feedback with, “There aren’t really guidelines (at least to
      my knowledge) that exist to help data visualization creators to ensure their work is accessible… [Chartability]
      helps to direct users to the most common accessibility problems with straightforward questions. It really helps to
      narrow the focus and prioritize efforts.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="chartability-helps-me-remember-and-stay-consistent">Chartability Helps me Remember and Stay Consistent</h2>
    <p>
      Among the accessibility experts, Zhang wrote, “While I am skilled, depending on the day I might not remember
      everything I need to look at. I am more confident in consistency between different auditing sessions. For experts
      it’s a good reminder framework.” Moseng of Highcharts noted, “[Chartability] did a very good job of highlighting
      concerns that are often ignored or forgotten when auditing and designing/developing.” Shugart of Microsoft added
      along those lines, “I feel [Chartability] arranges a good set of questions in a user’s mind and makes it easier
      for them to determine if a visualization is accessible.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="access-is-an-experience-not-just-compliance">Access is an Experience, not just Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Zhang offered insight into the design intention of Chartability, “[it is] clearly going for above compliance and
      focusing on a good experience.” Sam expressed their need to make an excellent accessibility experience, “I am not
      just worried about compliance, but I want to make something really good. Nothing seems to help you go beyond? This
      is better than WCAG, I can already tell.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="everyone-wants-more-evaluation-resources-and-tools">Everyone wants More Evaluation Resources and Tools</h2>
    <p>
      For constructive feedback, all the data experts noted that they wanted more resources and materials related to
      learning the skills needed to conduct an audit. Shugart and Moseng both noted that they hope for more tooling and
      (in some cases) automated tests that can take the burden off the auditor and streamline the design and development
      process (much like Axe-core&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_axe-core_2021"
        >[<a href="#ref-Deque2021Axe" id="noauthor_axe-core_202101" aria-label="27, Deque" title="27, Deque">27</a
        >]</span
      >). They both also agreed that automation and tooling would help novice practitioners perform this work faster and
      with more confidence. 2 of the 3 mentioned wanting more examples of failures as well as accessible data
      experiences. Sam wrote that they felt Chartability was overwhelming at first, but after focusing on just the
      Critical items, the rest of the framework “became easier.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="experts-novices-will-struggle.-novices-this-was-so-helpful">
      Experts: “Novices will Struggle.” Novices: “This was so helpful”
    </h2>
    <p>
      The accessibility experts all unanimously agreed that Chartability is helpful to their own work, but they are
      unsure how accessibility novices would do. They all believe that more training and resources are needed to help
      people who are new, with one noting that Chartability could even be “overwhelming” to someone who has not been
      exposed to accessibility work before. All of the novices remarked that Chartability was “so helpful,” “made this
      work so much clearer than before,” and “made a lot of hard problems not as hard.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-about-auditors-with-disabilities">What about Auditors with Disabilities?</h2>

      Shugart’s feedback was critical when discussing continuing to use Chartability, “I still feel as a screen reader
      user, the audit itself would have some unique challenges because I’d be missing a lot and would have problems
      determining things such as color.” He continued, “Auditing anything accessibility-wise as a screen reader user
      poses challenges because you don’t always know what you’re missing. In many cases there are workarounds to this
      but datavis is one area where this is really hard to do now.”

      demonstrate (in a pragmatic way) that Chartability has some merit:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>It is living and growing</strong>: Chartability has received enough community feedback that it is now
          on Version 2, with more tests and background resources provided.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>People are talking about it</strong>: Chartability has been featured in 14 workshops, talks, and
          podcasts and at least 2 university courses.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>People are using it</strong>: Chartability has contributed to projects at Microsoft, Highcharts,
          Project Jupyter, Fizz Studio, FiveThirtyEight, Vega-Lite, UCLA, the City of San Francisco, the Missouri School
          of Journalism, a fortune 50 company, two Fortune 500 companies, and community groups (like MiR).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>It has breadth</strong>: Chartability has evaluated static and interactive data experiences made with
          Microsoft’s Excel and PowerBI, Tableau, JavaScript (D3, Vega-Lite, Highcharts, Visa Chart Components), Python
          (Altair, Bokeh, and matplotlib), R (ggplot2), as well as design sketches and low/medium-fidelity artifacts
          (Illustrator, Figma, Sketch).

      we wanted to make sure that we created an artifact (assistive technology or otherwise) that would at least survive
      its first year of use in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater community feedback as well as new research before and after open-sourcing Chartability has also led to
      5 new heuristics being added since our test users performed audits and gave evaluations. The current version of
      Chartability (v2) has a total of 50 heuristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that the work of Chartability did not begin and does not conclude with the publication of
      this manuscript. We want Chartability to become a living, community-driven effort that will adapt and grow as more
      resources, tools, and research become available.
    </p>
    <h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
    <p>
      From our presentation of Chartability and a preliminary user evaluation with data visualization and accessibility
      practitioners, we learned that Chartability reduced the perception that working on accessibility is difficult and
      increased the confidence of those new to this work. Chartability shows promise as a useful framework for expert
      accessibility practitioners because it serves to produce consistency in contexts like the evaluation of
      dashboards, data science workflows, and other complex, data-driven interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      While our practitioners with novice accessibility experience were initially concerned about doing the audit
      correctly, most of their audit results were reasonably comparable with that of the authors (although their time to
      complete was much longer).
    </p>
    <p>
      We agree with experts that beyond Chartability, more resources are needed which provide examples of both
      inaccessible and accessible data visualizations as well as how to perform some of the more difficult parts of the
      auditing process (such as evaluating with a screen reader). We hope that keeping Chartability on GitHub will
      inspire future improvements to address this gap in examples, and will address future limitations, as we discover
      them.
    </p>
    <p>Chartability is a valuable tool for auditing. But we also hope that it can inspire researchers to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Examine which heuristics (in our supplemental materials) could use more research attention, particularly those
          labelled “community practice.”
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Define constraints or requirements on novel projects, ensuring that new explorations still respects
          established standards, mitigating ethical risks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Explore the intersections of disability in ways yet unaddressed in standards, such as the strong overlaps
          between understandability and operability (like keyboard navigation patterns across a data structure) or
          conflicts in understandability and flexibility (how some users need redundant encodings on charts while others
          find this overwhelming).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Consider access barriers in data experiences beyond those related to visual perception.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Engage the relationship between labor and access in computing, such as developing more measurements that
          demonstrate the imbalance of time and effort expected of users with disabilities (even in systems considered
          to provide “equal” access) and ways to evaluate who is contributing to accessibility efforts in a project
          (core team members, contractors, or volunteers).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We also want to caution researchers who are considering developing heuristics or auditing tools for use in
      practitioner environments to consider the tradeoffs between evaluation in rich, authentic professional settings
      and concerns such as intellectual property and corporate branding. We were able to apply our work in rich and
      collaborative practitioner settings because we were permissive with our potential participants. However, much of
      this work exists behind closed doors, similar to the downsides of industry research settings. More work may need
      to be done in order to encourage rich, cross-industry research projects, such as helping to anonymize the content
      of intellectual property and not just participants, while retaining data and findings.
    </p>
    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      The demand for accessible data experiences is long overdue. The Web Accessibility Initiative’s (WAI) Web Content
      Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are over 22 years old and yet little work has been done to synthesize this large
      body of existing accessibility standards with research and inclusive design principles relevant to the fields of
      data communication, data science, data analysis, and visualization. Chartability begins to address unique
      accessibility best practice gaps in these domains with specific heuristics. This synthesis is meant to empower
      researchers, analysts, designers, developers, editors, and accessibility specialists with a framework to audit the
      accessibility of data experiences, interfaces, and systems to produce more inclusive environments for users with
      disabilities. The goal of Chartability is to make this work easier in order to encourage practitioners to regard
      current practices and resources, some of which have existed for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Chartability opens the door to more work that remains to be explored in this space. Additional
      research is needed into many of the topic areas within Chartability’s heuristic principles (POUR+CAF) as well as
      resources, examples, and tools provided for practitioners to perform this work more confidently and efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The changing landscape of visualization techniques and alternative interfaces (such as sonification and dynamic
      tactile graphics) may increase the demands for accessibility considerations in this space. The growing
      technological divide will become an even greater human rights issue as time moves on and we believe that tools
      like Chartability are necessary for the community of data practitioners to ensure they are including people with
      disabilities.
