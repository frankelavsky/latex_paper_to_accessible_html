<div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
<p>Novices and experts have struggled to evaluate the accessibility of
data visualizations because there are no common shared guidelines across
environments, platforms, and contexts in which data visualizations are
authored. Between non-specific standards bodies like WCAG, emerging
research, and guidelines from specific communities of practice, it is
hard to organize knowledge on how to evaluate accessible data
visualizations. We present Chartability, a set of heuristics synthesized
from these various sources which enables designers, developers,
researchers, and auditors to evaluate data-driven visualizations and
interfaces for visual, motor, vestibular, neurological, and cognitive
accessibility. In this paper, we outline our process of making a set of
heuristics and accessibility principles for Chartability and highlight
key features in the auditing process. Working with participants on real
projects, we found that data practitioners with a novice level of
accessibility skills were more confident and found auditing to be easier
after using Chartability. Expert accessibility practitioners were eager
to integrate Chartability into their own work. Reflecting on
Chartability’s development and the preliminary user evaluation, we
discuss tradeoffs of open projects, working with high-risk evaluations
like auditing projects in the wild, and challenge future research
projects at the intersection of visualization and accessibility to
consider the broad intersections of disabilities.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>26% of people in the United States self-report living with at least
one disability&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="cdc_disability_2018">[<a href="#ref-cdc_disability_2018" id="cdc_disability_201801" aria-label="1, C. Okoro" title="1, C. Okoro">1</a>]</span>. Of those, 13.7% live with a
mobility disability and 10.8% with a cognitive disability. Globally, the
World Health Organization reports that 29% of the world lives with
uncorrected or uncorrectable blindness, low vision, or moderate to
severe visual impairment&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_world_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_world_nodate" id="noauthor_world_nodate01" aria-label="13, W. H. Organization" title="13, W. H. Organization">13</a>]</span>. Access is a significant
inclusion effort that has broad international impact, especially for
data visualization.</p>
<p>Accessibility is the practice of making information, content, and
functionality fully available to and usable by people with disabilities.
As part of this process, practitioners need to be able to identify
accessibility barriers. While general accessibility standards help,
evaluating the inaccessibility of complex data systems can be a daunting
and often expensive task. State-of-the art automated compliance checkers
only find 57% of accessibility errors&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_study_2021">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_study_2021" id="noauthor_study_202101" aria-label="53, Deque" title="53, Deque">53</a>]</span>, meaning accessible experiences
must still be manually designed and checked for quality. And following
standards may only account for up to half of the needs of people with
disabilities <span class="citation" data-cites="power_2012">[<a href="#ref-power_2012" id="power_201201" aria-label="86, C. Power" title="86, C. Power">86</a>]</span>
anyway. Additionally, the intended wide applicability of these general
standards means they fall short for information-rich systems, such as
data visualizations (which use size, color, angles, shapes, and other
dimensions to encode information). These specific contexts, communities,
and libraries that deal with data visualizations and information-rich
interfaces often have their own tools and guidelines for use, but they
seldom include accessibility. Finally, research at the intersection of
data visualization and accessibility has yet to meaningfully permeate
data visualization tools and communities and primarily focuses on
blindness and low vision, neglecting diverse accessibility needs of
people with other disabilities.</p>
<p>Synthesizing evolving accessibility standards, research findings, and
artifacts from communities of practice into usable knowledge for a
specific, evolving domain is a wicked problem. To address this, we
present Chartability. Chartability is an accessibility evaluation system
specific to data visualizations and interfaces which aims to help
practitioners answer the question, “how accessible is my data
visualization?” Chartability organizes knowledge from disparate bodies
of work into testable heuristics based on the functional accessibility
principles POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and
Robust)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="initiative_wai_accessibility_nodate">[<a href="#ref-initiative_wai_accessibility_nodate" id="initiative_wai_accessibility_nodate01" aria-label="52, WAI" title="52, WAI">52</a>]</span> and 3 novel
principles CAF (Compromising, Assistive, and Flexible), which we added
to attend to the unique qualities and demands of data visualizations. We
refer to these 7 heuristic principles as POUR+CAF. Chartability is a
community-contributed project that leverages the governance strategies
of open source projects as a way to address the complex dual-evolution
of both accessibility and data interaction practices.</p>
<p>We additionally present an initial, light evaluation of Chartability
from the experience of practitioners using it. We set out to see if
using Chartability reduces the barrier of entry into this work for
accessibility novices and if accessibility experts had any feedback to
share about its use. We gave practitioners introductory material for
Chartability and instructed them to use it according to their needs. We
found that before using Chartability only accessibility experts believed
auditing data visualizations to be somewhat easy or easy, while the
other group believed auditing data visualizations to be somewhat hard or
hard. All novice accessibility practitioners became more confident after
using Chartability and believed auditing data visualizations for
accessibility to be less difficult. Conversely while the expert
accessibility practitioners were already confident in their ability to
evaluate accessibility (and all unanimously had no change in their
before and after evaluations), they were excited to adopt Chartability
into their set of auditing resources.</p>
<p>Our work sets out to acknowledge that data practitioners face
significant barriers when first making data visualizations, systems, and
experiences accessible. While Chartability contributes to filling gaps
and organizing knowledge, it also challenges visualization and data
interaction researchers to explore new horizons of possibilities in this
space. As such, we conclude with recommendations for future research at
the crossroads of data visualization and accessibility.</p>

<p>While recent works at the intersection of data visualization and
accessibility are promising, they do not provide a consistent and

work across the broad spectrum of disability considerations.</p>

Advancements in Data Visualization and Accessibility</h2>
<p>In parallel to Mack <span>et&nbsp;al</span>’s “What do we mean by
Accessibility Research?”&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="mack_what_2021">[<a href="#ref-mack_what_2021" id="mack_what_202101" aria-label="93, K. Mack" title="93, K. Mack">93</a>]</span> when we asked “What do we mean by
data visualization accessibility research?” we found that nearly all
topics of study were vision-related. Largely, access issues other than
vision that affect data visualization (such as cognitive/neurological,
vestibular, and motor concerns) are almost entirely unserved in this
research space. Kim <span>et&nbsp;al</span> found that 56 papers have been
published between 1999 and 2020 that focus on vision-related
accessibility (not including color vision deficiency), with only 3 being
published at a visualization venue (and only recently since 2018)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="kim_accessible_2021">[<a href="#ref-kim_accessible_2021" id="kim_accessible_202101" aria-label="87, N. W. Kim" title="87, N. W. Kim">87</a>]</span>. Marriott
<span>et&nbsp;al</span> found that there is no research at all that engages
motor accessibility&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="marriott_inclusive_2021">[<a href="#ref-marriott_inclusive_2021" id="marriott_inclusive_202101" aria-label="88, K. Marriott et al." title="88, K. Marriott et al.">88</a>]</span>. We have found 2 papers
that engage cognitive/neurological disability in visualization and 1
student poster from IEEE Vis, which are all recent (specifically
intellectual developmental disabilities&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="wu_understanding_2021">[<a href="#ref-wu_understanding_2021" id="wu_understanding_202101" aria-label="34, K.

found no papers that engage vestibular accessibility, such as motion and
animation-related accessibility. We also found that there is no research
specific to low vision disabilities (not blindness or color vision
deficiency) unless conflated with screen reader usage in data
visualization. Blind and low vision people are often researched
together, but in practice may use different assistive technologies (such
as magnifiers and contrast enhancers) and have different interaction
practices (such as a combination of sight, magnification, and screen
reader use)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="szpiro_2016">[<a href="#ref-szpiro_2016" id="szpiro_201601" aria-label="17, S. F. A. Szpiro" title="17, S. F. A. Szpiro">17</a>]</span>.</p>

These research projects produce artifacts that are high-cost for
individual use, some are not robust enough to interpret complex
visualizations effectively, and several have not included people with
disabilities. Since our goal is to synthesize knowledge for practitioner
accessibility work, we also acknowledge that some of these projects did
not follow standards during their research project and in their output,
such as using Web Content Accessibility Guidelines&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_web_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_web_nodate" id="noauthor_web_nodate01" aria-label="20, W. A. Initiative" title="20, W. A. Initiative">20</a>]</span> or The

We encourage work to continue at the intersection of accessibility and

research that either builds on or explicitly challenges standards.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-practices-in-data-visualization-tools-and-libraries">Accessibility
Practices in Data Visualization Tools and Libraries</h2>
<p>Our research goals are to find what is already being done in data
visualization and accessibility and to see if we can enhance that
activity. To this aim, our background investigation includes a broad and
comprehensive exploration of the field of practitioner and non-academic
artifacts.</p>
<p>Some open source and industry contributions have pushed data
visualization and related accessibility efforts. Libraries like
Highcharts&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_accessibility_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_accessibility_nodate" id="noauthor_accessibility_nodate01" aria-label="63, Highsoft" title="63, Highsoft">63</a>]</span> or Visa Chart
Components (VCC)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="vcc">[<a href="#ref-vcc" id="vcc01" aria-label="64, Visa" title="64, Visa">64</a>]</span> and
tools like the Graphics Accelerator in SAS&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_sas_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_sas_nodate" id="noauthor_sas_nodate01" aria-label="83, SAS" title="83, SAS">83</a>]</span> have broad accessibility
functionality built in, but their documentation is technically specific
to their implementation. While these relatively accessible libraries and
tools can be helpful for inspiration, their specific techniques and
guidance materials are not easily transferrable to other environments or
applications where data visualizations are created. Practitioners must
reverse engineer and deconstruct many of the methods employed by these
libraries, and with the exception of VCC (which is open source), this
task requires significant effort, given their primarily closed-box
nature.</p>
<p>In common charting tools and libraries (apart from those already
mentioned) accessibility engineering is often not present, limited in
scope, or has only recently become an effort. More established
visualization libraries like matplotlib, ggplot2, d3js, R-Shiny, and
Plotly have left most accessibility efforts to developers, with varying
levels of documentation and difficulty involved&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_are_2018 noauthor_making_2018 noauthor_revealing_nodate noauthor_solved_2019 simon_making_2020">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_are_2018" id="noauthor_are_201801" aria-label="67, P.

None of these major tools have a broad spectrum of accessibility options
built in and documented.</p>
<p>Community contributors often must fight to make their tools and
environments accessible (sometimes even against the design of the tools
themselves) with little to no compensation for their contributions. For
example, Tableau’s first accessible data table was built by a volunteer
community member Toan Hong as an extension&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="hoang_tableaumagic_2018">[<a href="#ref-hoang_tableaumagic_2018" id="hoang_tableaumagic_201801" aria-label="14, T. Hoang" title="14, T. Hoang">14</a>]</span>. Tableau users more broadly
must resort to voting systems to gather attention to accessibility
issues&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="demartini_tableau_nodate-1">[<a href="#ref-demartini_tableau_nodate-1" id="demartini_tableau_nodate-101" aria-label="19, C. DeMartini" title="19, C. DeMartini">19</a>]</span>. Semiotic’s
accessibility features were added by community member Melanie
Mazanec&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_semiotic_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_semiotic_nodate" id="noauthor_semiotic_nodate01" aria-label="35, M. Mazanec" title="35, M. Mazanec">35</a>]</span>. For Microsoft’s PowerBI,
students have organized resources for how to make visualizations built

keyboard instructions from scratch&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_covid-19_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_covid-19_nodate" id="noauthor_covid-19_nodate01" aria-label="15, C. of San Francisco" title="15, C. of San Francisco">15</a>]</span>. Mapbox GL JS is an
example of a popular mapping library (over 400,000 weekly
downloads)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_mapbox-gl_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_mapbox-gl_nodate" id="noauthor_mapbox-gl_nodate01" aria-label="12, Mapbox" title="12, Mapbox">12</a>]</span> that has no built-in
accessibility support by default. The accessibility module for Mapbox GL
on GitHub was created and maintained by volunteers but has had less than
10 weeks of work with any activity invested since its first activity in
late 2017&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_mapboxmapbox-gl-accessibility_2021">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_mapboxmapbox-gl-accessibility_2021" id="noauthor_mapboxmapbox-gl-accessibility_202101" aria-label="71, Mapbox" title="71, Mapbox">71</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Many community-driven efforts are under-utilized, must be discovered
outside of the primary environment’s ecosystem, have poor or no core,
internal support, and are inconsistently and partially implemented.
Accessibility is still an afterthought in data visualization and ad-hoc,
specific solutions proposed have not led to widespread improvements.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-in-practice-broadly">Accessibility in Practice,

<p>Accessibility in practice is largely motivated by standards work or

transferability to digital contexts currently. For example, whereas
tactile graphics guidelines lend insight into information
prioritization, layout, and fidelity, the assumption is they will be
embossed onto paper or similar physical mediums&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="bigham_vizwiz_2010 lundgard_sociotechnical_2019 sharif_understanding_2021">[<a href="#ref-bigham_vizwiz_2010" id="bigham_vizwiz_201001" aria-label="55, J.

<p>In digital contexts, the most influential body for accessibility is
the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative
(WAI). WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_web_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_web_nodate" id="noauthor_web_nodate11" aria-label="20, W. A. Initiative" title="20, W. A. Initiative">20</a>]</span> influence

<h2 id="using-heuristics-to-break-into-under-addressed-areas">Using
Heuristics to Break Into Under-addressed Areas</h2>
<p>To summarize the complex problem space to which this paper
contributes: Research in data visualization primarily focuses on visual
accessibility, accessibility standards focus on a broad range of
disabilities but lack deep contextualization for data visualization, and
practitioners seem to build a wide array of solutions to fill these
gaps, most of which are poorly maintained or adopted. Any time a
practitioner wants to embark on a journey learning how to evaluate the
accessibility of a data visualization, they must collect and synthesize
this complex space of knowledge themselves. We have included (with
permission) an exemplary field artifact as an example of this type of
labor in our supplemental materials, which contributed to the United
States Government’s project, “Improving Accessibility in Data
Visualizations”&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_improving_nodate noauthor_data_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_improving_nodate" id="noauthor_improving_nodate01" aria-label="96, US Government" title="96, US Government">96</a>, <a href="#ref-noauthor_data_nodate" id="noauthor_data_nodate01" aria-label="95, US Government" title="95, US Government">95</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>After gathering information with this breadth and complexity, a
heuristic evaluation model was chosen as a way to deliver useful but
flexible knowledge. Heuristic evaluation models have a long history in
HCI and are cheap to use and require little expertise. They have been
shown to be effective methods for practitioners compared to user
testing, focus groups, or other evaluative methods that require existing
expert knowledge or recruitment, moderation, and compensation of
participants&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="martinez_methodology_2021 chuan_usability_2015 brangier_beyond_2018 experience_10_nodate joyce_mobile_2016 nielsen_heuristic_1994 otey_methodology_2017 santos_heuristic_2018 slavkovic_novice_1999 noauthor_unlocking_2018">[<a href="#ref-martinez_methodology_2021" id="martinez_methodology_202111" aria-label="43, R.

<h1 id="making-chartability">Making Chartability</h1>
<p>We next present Elavsky’s work to develop Chartability as a
real-world design process contribution to the larger research community.
Our making process does not neatly fit into most design models that
divide researchers from practitioners. In Gray’s different models of
practitioner-researcher relations, our work is some variation of
bubble-up, practitioner-led research&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="gray_reprioritizing_2014">[<a href="#ref-gray_reprioritizing_2014" id="gray_reprioritizing_201401" aria-label="105, C. M. Gray" title="105, C. M. Gray">105</a>]</span>. This project was
initiated by Elavsky while they were an industry practitioner, deeply
situated in this work already.</p>
<p>Thus, the following description of Chartability’s 10-month creation
is written from Elavsky’s perspective. The supplemental materials
include the data from this stage of the process, a preview of which is

<li><p><strong>Situate, Survey, and Select Problem Space</strong>: I was
situated within the context of accessibility evaluations of data
visualizations. From personal experience, I recognized the prohibitively
significant labor involved in ensuring I was effectively following
accessibility standards while also attending to the complex design
considerations of data visualizations. To improve this work both for
myself and others in the future, I surveyed existing problems and
challenges others faced and selected a solution that I felt equipped to
address.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collect Existing Resources</strong>: I set out to answer,
“If evaluating the accessibility of data experiences is hard, what do
existing standards miss?” I evaluated my seed knowledge (WCAG criteria)
for shortcomings and gaps and collected other data relevant to my goal
(academic and industry research, open-source libraries, tools,
applications, data products, government guidelines, design guidelines,
software documentation, university coursework, and practitioner
articles).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Resources</strong>: After collating these resources
(including relevant WCAG criteria), I loosely borrowed from thematic
analysis&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="braun_clarke_thematic_2006">[<a href="#ref-braun_clarke_thematic_2006" id="braun_clarke_thematic_200601" aria-label="100, V. Braun and V. Clarke" title="100, V. Braun and V. Clarke">100</a>]</span> and qualitatively coded
this data. I developed a set of 29 codes starting with WCAG’s POUR
principles and expanded the codes to account for other concerns that
came up in the resources, including what type of accessibility was being
addressed (e.g., cognitive, visual), whether a solution was
technology-specific or agnostic, and other categories (like
“time-consuming” or “user-controlled”). I then divided the resources
into codable segments with relatively distinct pieces of information and
applied the 29 codes to the information segments. I grouped information
with codes in common, resulting in a representative 45 groups of related
information segments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synthesize Heuristics</strong>: Since auditing depends on
measurable heuristics, I adjusted each of the 45 groupings that resulted
from the qualitative analysis into phrasing that could be verified by an
evaluation. I then augmented each heuristic with known testing
procedures, resources, and tools necessary for applying them in
practice. 10 critical heuristics (these were determined top priorities
through user feedback) are previewed in <a href="#tab:table" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="tab:table">[tab:table]</a>, with the full version of
this table (and more) provided in our supplemental materials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Group Heuristics into Higher-level Principles</strong>: I
linked each heuristic with relevant web accessibility standards and POUR
principles to draw a familiar connection for users who might already be
accessibility practitioners. 26 heuristics fit neatly back into
Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, or Robust.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop Remaining Themes into New Principles</strong>: 19
remaining heuristics with complex codes and overlapping groups demanded
new theorizing, as they either did not fit into POUR at all or could
arguably belong to multiple principles at once. I analyzed these
remaining complex heuristics and for similarities and organized them
under 3 new themes, which we are contributing as new accessibility
principles, Compromising, Assistive, and Flexible, defined
below.</p></li>

<h2 id="compromising">Compromising</h2>
<p>Compromising is a principle that focuses on Understandable, yet
Robust heuristics. These heuristics are based on providing alternative,
transparent, tolerant, information flows with consideration for
different ways that users of assistive technologies and users with
disabilities need to consume information.</p>
<p>Compromising challenges designs that only allow access to information
through limited or few interfaces or processes. These heuristics focus
on providing information at a low and high level (such as tables and
summaries), transparency about the state of complex interactions, error
tolerance, and that data structures can be navigated according to their
presentation. Compromising designs have both information and system
redundancies in place.</p>
<h2 id="assistive">Assistive</h2>
<p>Assistive is a principle that primarily builds off the intersection
of Understandable and Perceivable principles but focuses on the labor
involved in access. These heuristics include categories that encourage
data interfaces to be intelligent and multi-sensory in a way that
reduces the cognitive and functional labor required of the user as much
as possible.</p>
<p>The Assistive principle focuses on what Swan <span>et&nbsp;al</span> refer
to as “adding value”&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_inclusive_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_inclusive_nodate" id="noauthor_inclusive_nodate01" aria-label="81, H. Swan" title="81, H. Swan">81</a>]</span> and what Doug Schepers
meant by “data visualization is an assistive technology”&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_why_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_why_nodate" id="noauthor_why_nodate01" aria-label="54, D. Schepers" title="54, D. Schepers">54</a>]</span>. We visualize
because it is faster and more efficient than munging cell at a time
through data. Assistive heuristics ensure that both visual and
non-visual data representations add value for people with
disabilities.</p>
<h2 id="flexible">Flexible</h2>
<p>Contrasted with Compromising (which focuses on robust understanding),
flexible heuristics focus on robust user agency and the ability to
adjust the Perceivable and Operable traits of a data experience.
Flexible heuristics all have a tight coupling between a data experience
and the larger technological context the user inhabits. The preferences
that a user sets in lower-level systems must be respected in higher
level environments.</p>
<p>Self-advocacy and interdependent agency are important sociotechnical
considerations that engage the conflicting access needs that different
users might have in complex technological interactions like data
experiences&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="bennett_interdependence_2018 mankoff_disability_2010">[<a href="#ref-bennett_interdependence_2018" id="bennett_interdependence_201801" aria-label="30, C. L. Bennett" title="30, C. L. Bennett">30</a>, <a href="#ref-mankoff_disability_2010" id="mankoff_disability_201001" aria-label="42, J. Mankoff" title="42, J. Mankoff">42</a>]</span>.
Some users might want specific controls or presentation, while others
might want something else entirely. Designs must not be rigid in their
opinions and ability assumptions and should be designed to be moldable
by and adaptive to user needs&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="wobbrock_ability-based_2011 ladner_design_2015">[<a href="#ref-wobbrock_ability-based_2011" id="wobbrock_ability-based_201101" aria-label="82, J. O. Wobbrock" title="82, J. O. Wobbrock">82</a>, <a href="#ref-ladner_design_2015" id="ladner_design_201501" aria-label="104, R. E. Ladner" title="104, R. E. Ladner">104</a>]</span>.</p>
<h1 id="using-chartability">Using Chartability</h1>
<p>All of Chartability’s tests are performed using Chartability’s
workbook&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_chartability_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_chartability_nodate" id="noauthor_chartability_nodate01" aria-label="80, F. Elavsky" title="80, F. Elavsky">80</a>]</span> alongside various
tools and software (linked in the workbook). For the scope of this
paper, we are not including an explanation for how to perform all of
these. Both the workbook and supplementary materials with this paper
give more details.</p>
<p>While a highly trained auditor may be able to casually evaluate an
artifact in as little as 30 minutes or even hold heuristics in mind as
they are doing their own creative work, those new to auditing may take
anywhere between 2 and 8 hours to complete a full pass of Chartability.
Professional audits, which can take weeks or months, often include
multiple auditors and provide rigorous documentation and detailed
recommendations for remediation, typically in the form of a report.
Chartability is meant to serve both quick pass and deep dive styles of
audits, so users are expected to leverage it as they see fit.</p>
<p>Below we give an example of what might be a quick pass audit, using
Chartability. Which principles are applied in each of these stages are
listed in parentheses in each heading.</p>
<h2 id="visual-testing-perceivable">Visual Testing (Perceivable)</h2>
<figure>
<img src="figures/figure 2.png" id="fig:2" alt="A low contrast chart (left) compared to a higher contrast version (right). A dropper tool is extracting the fill color of the bar and then a contrast ratio has been calculated.

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A low contrast chart (left) compared to a
higher contrast version (right). A dropper tool is extracting the fill
color of the bar and then a contrast ratio has been calculated. Note
that the fill color is the same on both bars, but darker borders have
been added to ensure the visualization passes contrast
tests.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Checking for contrast is the most common critical failure; 87.5% of
tests (7 out of 8) from our user study involving this heuristic failed,
which supports the WebAim Million Report’s findings (83.9% of the top 1
million websites also fail contrast testing, more than any other WCAG
criteria)&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_webaim_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_webaim_nodate" id="noauthor_webaim_nodate01" aria-label="11, WebAIM" title="11, WebAIM">11</a>]</span>. In order to evaluate
contrast, often a combination of automatic (code-driven) and manual
tooling is performed. When manually auditing, practitioners typically
use a dropper and a contrast calculator (<a href="#fig:2" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:2">[fig:2]</a>). Most
auditors find this to be one of the easiest tasks to perform and
accomplishes 3 different heuristics in Chartability: ensuring
text/geometries have contrast, interactive states for elements have
enough contrast change, and the keyboard focus indicator is easy to
distinguish.</p>
<p>Perceivable heuristics also include tests and tools for color vision
deficiency and ensuring that color alone isn’t used to communicate
meaning (like the redundantly encoded textures in <a href="#fig:9" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:9">[fig:9]</a>). And
another common, critical failure from Perceivable is text size. No text
should be smaller than 12px/9pt in size.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/figure 3.png" id="fig:3" alt="Keyboard navigation paths on a stacked bar chart. The left shows a serial navigation example, typically just a default of rendering order. The right shows both groups (the stack of bars) and categories (the color/texture shared among bars across stacks) as dimensions to explore laterally or vertically.">

as dimensions to explore laterally or vertically.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="keyboard-probing-operable-assistive">Keyboard Probing (Operable,
Assistive)</h2>
<p>The next practice that most auditors should become comfortable with
is using a keyboard to navigate and operate any functionality that is
provided. Most assistive technologies, from screen readers to a variety
of input devices (like switches, joysticks, sip and puffs, etc) use the
keyboard api (or keyboard interface) to navigate content. If a data
interface contains interactive elements (<a href="#fig:3" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:3">[fig:3]</a>, <a href="#fig:4" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:4">[fig:4]</a>), those elements (or their
functionality) must be able to be reached and controlled using a
keyboard alone. Auditors should be critical of how much work is involved
in keyboard navigation, especially (<a href="#fig:8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:8">[fig:8]</a>). All
that is required to start is the auditor begins pressing the tab key to
see if anything interactive comes into focus. Arrow keys, spacebar,
enter, and escape may be used in some contexts. Generally, instructions
or cues should always be provided.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/figure 4.png" id="fig:4" alt="A mouse cursor is selecting a bar (left, shown with a thick indication border) in a stacked bar chart to filter a dataset (on the right). A system alert (red box) notifies the user of their interaction result. This selection capability must also be provided for the keyboard interface and the alert must be announced to screen readers.">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A mouse cursor is selecting a bar (left,

dataset (on the right). A system alert (red box) notifies the user of
their interaction result. This selection capability must also be
provided for the keyboard interface and the alert must be announced to
screen readers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using a keyboard provides an opportunity to evaluate many different
heuristics: checking for multiple inputs (<a href="#fig:4" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:4">[fig:4]</a>),
whether the data structure that is rendered is navigable according to
its structure (<a href="#fig:3" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:3">[fig:3]</a>), and whether keyboard navigability
across all elements in a data interface is even necessary (<a href="#fig:8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:8">[fig:8]</a>).</p>
<h2 id="screen-reader-inspecting-perceivable-operable-robust-assistive">Screen
Reader Inspecting (Perceivable, Operable, Robust, Assistive) </h2>
<p>Closely related to keyboard testing is testing with a screen reader.
Some things may work with a screen reader that do not with a keyboard
(and vice versa), so both must be evaluated.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/figure 5.png" id="fig:5" alt="Charts must have a visually available textual explanation provided that summarizes the outcome. “Client Registration Chart” for “Product X” (left) is inaccessible while “New Product Launch a Success” (right) gives a clear takeaway.">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Charts must have a visually available
textual explanation provided that summarizes the outcome. “Client
Registration Chart” for “Product X” (left) is inaccessible while “New
Product Launch a Success” (right) gives a clear takeaway.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Screen readers, unlike more basic keyboard input devices, read out
content that is textual (including non-visual textual information like
<em>alternative text</em>). Using a screen reader to audit is generally
the hardest skill to learn. Keeping this in mind, testing whether the
meaningful text provided in a visual (such as in <a href="#fig:5" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:5">[fig:5]</a>) is
accessible with a screen reader is the easiest and most basic test that
auditors should first perform.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/figure 6.png" id="fig:6" alt="An interactive chart displaying only “Image” as semantic information with no feedback provided on selection. The robust semantics given to a screen reader, “toggle button” (middle) as well instant feedback, “selected” (right) are considered proper semantics for an interactive experience.">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An interactive chart displaying only
“Image” as semantic information with no feedback provided on selection.
The robust semantics given to a screen reader, “toggle button” (middle)
as well instant feedback, “selected” (right) are considered proper
semantics for an interactive experience.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next, all valuable information and functionality in a data experience
should be tested whether it is available to a screen reader. This
includes the individual variables about a mark as well as whether that
mark is interactive (<a href="#fig:6" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:6">[fig:6]</a>), whether status updates that reflect
context change provide alerts (<a href="#fig:4" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:4">[fig:4]</a>), and
whether summary textual information is provided about the whole chart
(<a href="#fig:5" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:5">[fig:5]</a>) as well as statistically and
visually important areas of that chart (<a href="#fig:8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:8">[fig:8]</a>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/figure 7.png" id="fig:7" alt="A line chart (left) with a single line and an accompanying data table (right). This line chart would not provide enough low-level information about each datapoint without the table provided. A table alone however would also be inaccessible. Providing both can satisfy conflicting accessibility needs for different audiences.">

audiences.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="checking-cognitive-barriers-understandable-compromising">Checking
Cognitive Barriers (Understandable, Compromising)</h2>
<p>First, auditing for cognitive barriers generally involves checking
the reading level and clarity of all available text using analytical
tools. But Chartability also requires that all charts have basic text
that provides a visually-available textual description and takeaway (<a href="#fig:5" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:5">[fig:5]</a>). This alone is one of the most
important things to check for. In complex cases where a chart has a
visual feature with an assumedly obvious takeaway, checking for
annotations or textual callouts is important to help avoid interpretive
issues&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="xiong_curse_2020">[<a href="#ref-xiong_curse_2020" id="xiong_curse_202001" aria-label="94, C. Xiong" title="94, C. Xiong">94</a>]</span> (<a href="#fig:8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:8">[fig:8]</a>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/figure 8.png" id="fig:8" alt="A scatterplot with many points, where a single point within the chart can be accessed by a screen reader (left).

</figure>
<h2 id="evaluating-context-robust-assistive-flexible">Evaluating Context
(Robust, Assistive, Flexible) </h2>
<p>The final series of checks an auditor should make involve thinking
about the overall work in a design (as it intersects with other
considerations) as well as the larger technical context where the user
is situated.</p>
<p>Auditors should first try to change system settings (such as toggling
high contrast modes) to see whether a data experience respects these
settings (<a href="#fig:9" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:9">[fig:9]</a>), run automatic semantic evaluations
as well as manually check for appropriate meaning (<a href="#fig:6" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:6">[fig:6]</a>), and
check if dense or highly complex visuals have sonified, tactile, or
textual summaries available (<a href="#fig:8" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:8">[fig:8]</a>).
Auditors should also check whether system updates provide clear feedback
textually (<a href="#fig:4" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:4">[fig:4]</a>) as well as checking if there are
both high and low level representations of information available (<a href="#fig:7" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:7">[fig:7]</a>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/figure 9.png" id="fig:9" alt="A bar chart with categories (left) shown not conforming to Windows High Contrast White Mode. High contrast mode on Windows requires limiting color palettes, using only black or white for most elements (shown on the right).">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A bar chart with categories (left) shown
not conforming to Windows High Contrast White Mode. High contrast mode
on Windows requires limiting color palettes, using only black or white
for most elements (shown on the right).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Auditors should be especially critical of static designs, such as
those that either use textures by default or not (<a href="#fig:9" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="fig:9">[fig:9]</a>), which
are a high risk of compromising and assistive failure.</p>
<h1 id="validating-chartability">Validating Chartability</h1>
<p>Next, Elavsky explains the preliminary user evaluation: I validated
whether data practitioners felt more confident and equipped to make
their own work accessible with Chartability. Additionally, I also wanted
to interview expert accessibility practitioners (including those with
disabilities) with the same questions, to see if Chartability had
anything to offer in helping them understand and evaluate data
experiences better.</p>
<p>My secondary goal was to present a tool that can be helpful even in
the wild on real projects (with all the weird design and engineering
quirks that come with that). I wanted Chartability to be usable on
things built with a tool like Tableau and fully bespoke, hand-coded
visualizations, like those made with JavaScript and D3. To this
secondary aim, I intentionally solicited participants who were working
on a variety of different projects, each of their own design.</p>
<h2 id="pre-validations-and-flipped-roles-participants-question-me">Pre-Validations
and Flipped Roles: Participants Question <em>Me</em></h2>
<p>I performed several early, light validations of my work before
soliciting and involving participants formally. My early pre-validations
#2-4 (below) all focused on practitioners asking me questions and giving
feedback.</p>
<p>My 4 pre-validations happened during the process of making
Chartability, as well as introducing short iterations back into the
making process:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Beta Testing</strong>: I performed several beta tests of
Chartability during the process of making. I audited using versions that
only had POUR principles, tried versions of Chartability that focused
only on standards, and also tried out different iterations of the
heuristics as I was forming them. This testing was important to perform
early in the process because it helped me test the limits of various
possible directions for this tool (standards-only, against standards,
building off of standards, etc).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Advice</strong>: After the first full pass of
making Chartability was complete, I sent Chartability via email to 4
accessibility experts and 6 interested people with disabilities familiar
with auditing in order to solicit open feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professional Workshop</strong>: I held a half-day
professional workshop via zoom on auditing visualizations for
accessibility and presented Chartability’s heuristics to this select
audience of 50 participants. I demonstrated how to audit and then had a
chance for feedback and questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deep Feedback Session</strong>: I presented Chartability
to 14 experts on data visualization and accessibility, 5 of which are
people with disabilities. I presented in two separate sessions through
2-hour video calls on zoom (roughly one hour was demonstration and one
hour was discussion).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sec:critical heuristics">Discovering “Critical” Heuristics</h2>
<p>These pre-validations helped me combine and divide some of the
heuristics, adjust the language and phrasing, and label 10 specific
tests as “Critical,” which can be seen in <a href="#tab:table" data-reference-type="autoref" data-reference="tab:table">[tab:table]</a>. These critical tests were
ones that community members stressed as an important priority for one or
more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They are prohibitively expensive to fix late.</p></li>
<li><p>The barriers they produce are too significant to ignore.</p></li>
<li><p>They are among the most common type of accessibility
failure.</p></li>
<li><p>They affect many parts of a data experience.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All Critical heuristics are based on standards or research.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-participants-and-projects">Selecting Participants and
Projects</h2>
<p>I was a practitioner and representing myself as a volunteer when I
reached out to participants. At this stage in the project, I was still
not affiliated with a research institution and was not interested in
producing publishable knowledge. I intended to test Chartability in the
wild and validate whether it achieved its aims. My priority was to
collaborate with folks working on difficult problems or those who had a
rare intersection of expertise between accessibility standards and
interactive data experiences. To this end, I was highly permissive with
potential collaborators in order to maximize the expertise of
participants and breadth of environments for testing Chartability.</p>
<p>However, part of being permissive with participants meant that I was
willing to collaborate on projects that I cannot share in a research
publication and many of my participants must remain anonymous (including
interview results that contain sensitive information about intellectual
property). Given that auditing is a field of work about identifying
failures, there was both a high demand for participation in the
evaluation of Chartability in tension with a low motivation to make
these failures known in a public venue.</p>
<p>A summary of our selection process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Solicitation</strong>: I reached out via email to 24
individuals in my network to participate in helping to evaluate
Chartability. I mentioned that I wanted Chartability to be applied to a
current project of theirs and was interested in performing some
interviews about their experience before and after using Chartability. I
mentioned up front that working with me would be uncompensated and
potentially take multiple hours of their time (even multiple sessions)
over zoom meetings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Response</strong>: 16 individuals were interested and
shared their project details (2 would require an NDA to be
signed).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Selection</strong>: I selected 8, based either on the
expertise of the individuals, on the robustness of their project, and/or
on the opportunity to get feedback about Chartability in team
environments (which I didn’t anticipate, but 3 of the 8 represented team
efforts).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resulting Group</strong>: I worked with 19 total
participants across 8 environment spaces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publishable Group</strong>: Due to intellectual property
concerns, I can publish interview results from 6 participants and
discuss the details of 4 audit environments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chris DeMartini</strong>: a multi-year Tableau Zen Master and
recognized expert visualization practitioner. His dashboard of a coin
flipping probability game dataset that he produced with his daughter was
the subject of his audit&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_we_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_we_nodate" id="noauthor_we_nodate01" aria-label="7, C. DeMartini" title="7, C. DeMartini">7</a>]</span>. His audit only included
criteria labelled Critical in Chartability (which involves only 10 tests
instead of the full 45) and his dashboard failed 7 of them. A full audit
was later conducted on Chris’s behalf. His full audit had a total 26
failures, 11 of which were considered non-applicable.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Amber Thomas</strong>: a data storyteller and technologist
credited on 30 of The Pudding’s visual essays. Amber has had a growing
interest in accessibility challenges related to her line of work
designing and developing state of the art, bespoke visual essays. Her
article The Naked Truth was still in the early design and development
stages when it was fully audited&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_naked_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_naked_nodate" id="noauthor_naked_nodate01" aria-label="6, O. Amaka and A. Thomas" title="6, O. Amaka and A. Thomas">6</a>]</span>. It failed 22 out of 45
tests, including 6 out of 10 criteria considered Critical. 6 tests were
considered non-applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong> (self-selected pseudonym): a recognized design
practitioner in the visualization community who lives with disability.
They were collaborating on an interactive data project that would be
specifically made to be used by international participants with a broad
spectrum of disabilities. Their interactive infographic failed 21 out of
45 tests, 5 of which were considered Critical. 10 tests were considered
non-applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Øystein Moseng</strong>: Core Developer and Head of
Accessibility of Highcharts. Øystein was interested in taking one of
Highchart’s demo charts not specifically developed with accessibility
features in mind&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_fixed_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_fixed_nodate" id="noauthor_fixed_nodate01" aria-label="5, Highsoft" title="5, Highsoft">5</a>]</span> and testing it against a full
Chartability audit to see how it held up. The demo failed 13 out of 45
tests, 3 of which were Critical. 10 tests were considered
non-applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Zhang</strong>: a senior accessibility program
manager at Microsoft with expertise working on enterprise data
products.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Shugart</strong>: a blind, screen reader user and
disability subject matter expert at Microsoft who has a strong expertise
in collaborative accessibility for interactive data systems.</p>
<p>Both Shugart and Zhang were interested in applying Chartability
internally and testing its effectiveness and potential with various
projects. Their application and use of Chartability (including audits)
are not available for publication, but their valuable interviews and
evaluations are included with permission.</p>
<h1 id="study-results">Study Results</h1>
<p>I asked the 6 participants a series of qualitative and Likert-scale
evaluation questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Have you ever performed an audit of a data experience
before?</p></li>
<li><p>What stage of production is your project in? Analysis, design,
prototyping, development, maintenance?</p></li>
<li><p>How confident are you in your ability to perform an audit of a
data experience for accessibility issues? (1-5, 1 being not confident at
all, 5 being fully confident.)</p></li>
<li><p>How difficult do you perceive auditing a data experience for
accessibility issues is? (1-5, 1 being trivial, 5 being very
difficult.)</p></li>
<li><p>(After using Chartability) How confident are you in your ability
to perform an audit of a data experience for accessibility issues? (1-5,
1 being not confident at all, 5 being fully confident.)</p></li>
<li><p>(After using Chartability) How difficult do you perceive auditing
a data experience for accessibility issues is? (1-5, 1 being trivial, 5
being very difficult.)</p></li>
<li><p>(After using Chartability) Do you intend to continue using
Chartability?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these questions had an open-ended question attached, “Is
there anything else you would like to add?” Every participant provided
additional input on questions 3 through 7.</p>
<p>None of the 3 participants who only consider themselves expert data
practitioners had performed an audit before. All 3 of them reported that
they believed auditing to be easier and that they are more confident in
their ability to evaluate the accessibility of data experiences after
using Chartability.</p>
<p>Of the 3 accessibility experts (all of whom have performed audits of
data experiences before), their opinions on these measurements were
unchanged after using Chartability. All 6 participants noted that they
plan to use Chartability in their own work and would recommend it to
their peers.</p>
<p>Below we overview some of the key insights Elavsky received from the
open ended responses.</p>
<h2 id="real-access-has-more-considerations-than-colorblindness">Real
Access has more Considerations than Colorblindness</h2>
<p>Among the data practitioners, DeMartini wrote after his audit, “I
have read a lot about color blindness and could provide meaningful
feedback to visualization developers on that topic, but I have come to
realize that accessibility is so much more than this and I basically
didn’t really know where to start when it came to the true scope of
accessibility.” He ended his qualitative feedback with, “I think this
could be a great tool for the masses and really look forward to the
impact it can possibly have on the (inaccessible) data visualizations
which are being created in huge numbers these days.”</p>
<h2 id="audits-are-slow-but-help-me-focus">Audits are Slow, but Help me
Focus</h2>
<p>Amber Thomas wrote, “It still takes a while to do a complete audit,
but it’s not hard! For someone new to the space, all the possible
options that can be used to make visualizations more accessible can be
overwhelming. [Chartability] helped me to focus.” She finished her
feedback with, “There aren’t really guidelines (at least to my
knowledge) that exist to help data visualization creators to ensure
their work is accessible… [Chartability] helps to direct users to the
most common accessibility problems with straightforward questions. It
really helps to narrow the focus and prioritize efforts.”</p>
<h2 id="chartability-helps-me-remember-and-stay-consistent">Chartability
Helps me Remember and Stay Consistent</h2>
<p>Among the accessibility experts, Zhang wrote, “While I am skilled,
depending on the day I might not remember everything I need to look at.
I am more confident in consistency between different auditing sessions.
For experts it’s a good reminder framework.” Moseng of Highcharts noted,
“[Chartability] did a very good job of highlighting concerns that are
often ignored or forgotten when auditing and designing/developing.”
Shugart of Microsoft added along those lines, “I feel [Chartability]
arranges a good set of questions in a user’s mind and makes it easier
for them to determine if a visualization is accessible.”</p>
<h2 id="access-is-an-experience-not-just-compliance">Access is an
Experience, not just Compliance</h2>
<p>Zhang offered insight into the design intention of Chartability, “[it
is] clearly going for above compliance and focusing on a good
experience.” Sam expressed their need to make an excellent accessibility
experience, “I am not just worried about compliance, but I want to make
something really good. Nothing seems to help you go beyond? This is
better than WCAG, I can already tell.”</p>
<h2 id="everyone-wants-more-evaluation-resources-and-tools">Everyone
wants More Evaluation Resources and Tools</h2>
<p>For constructive feedback, all the data experts noted that they
wanted more resources and materials related to learning the skills
needed to conduct an audit. Shugart and Moseng both noted that they hope
for more tooling and (in some cases) automated tests that can take the
burden off the auditor and streamline the design and development process
(much like Axe-core&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_axe-core_2021">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_axe-core_2021" id="noauthor_axe-core_202101" aria-label="4, Deque" title="4, Deque">4</a>]</span>). They both also agreed that
automation and tooling would help novice practitioners perform this work
faster and with more confidence. 2 of the 3 mentioned wanting more
examples of failures as well as accessible data experiences. Sam wrote
that they felt Chartability was overwhelming at first, but after
focusing on just the Critical items, the rest of the framework “became
easier.”</p>
<h2 id="experts-novices-will-struggle.-novices-this-was-so-helpful">Experts:
“Novices will Struggle.” Novices: “This was so helpful”</h2>
<p>The accessibility experts all unanimously agreed that Chartability is
helpful to their own work, but they are unsure how accessibility novices
would do. They all believe that more training and resources are needed
to help people who are new, with one noting that Chartability could even
be “overwhelming” to someone who has not been exposed to accessibility
work before. All of the novices remarked that Chartability was “so
helpful,” “made this work so much clearer than before,” and “made a lot
of hard problems not as hard.”</p>
<h2 id="what-about-auditors-with-disabilities">What about Auditors with
Disabilities?</h2>
<p>Shugart’s feedback was critical when discussing continuing to use
Chartability, “I still feel as a screen reader user, the audit itself
would have some unique challenges because I’d be missing a lot and would
have problems determining things such as color.” He continued, “Auditing
anything accessibility-wise as a screen reader user poses challenges
because you don’t always know what you’re missing. In many cases there
are workarounds to this but datavis is one area where this is really
hard to do now.”</p>
<h1 id="extended-results">Extended Results</h1>
<p>Following calls to ensure accessibility work has practical benefits
that exceed publications&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="hurst_making_2013">[<a href="#ref-hurst_making_2013" id="hurst_making_201301" aria-label="26, A. Hurst and S. Kane" title="26, A. Hurst and S. Kane">26</a>]</span>, in April, 2021 Elavsky made
Chartability openly available on Github. As new research and practices
emerge and more community members get involved, Chartability will become
an evolving artifact of consensus similar to existing standards
bodies&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_w3c_nodate">[<a href="#ref-noauthor_w3c_nodate" id="noauthor_w3c_nodate01" aria-label="97, WAI" title="97, WAI">97</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Projects like Turkopticon benefited from the discussion about how a
community actually used their tool&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="irani_turkopticon_13">[<a href="#ref-irani_turkopticon_13" id="irani_turkopticon_1301" aria-label="98, L. C. Irani and M. S. Silberman" title="98, L. C. Irani and M. S. Silberman">98</a>]</span>. In the same vein, we are
happy to report some valuable findings from within this last year that
we think demonstrate (in a pragmatic way) that Chartability has some
merit:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>It is living and growing</strong>: Chartability has
received enough community feedback that it is now on Version 2, with
more tests and background resources provided.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People are talking about it</strong>: Chartability has
been featured in 14 workshops, talks, and podcasts and at least 2
university courses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People are using it</strong>: Chartability has
contributed to projects at Microsoft, Highcharts, Project Jupyter, Fizz
Studio, FiveThirtyEight, Vega-Lite, UCLA, the City of San Francisco, the
Missouri School of Journalism, a fortune 50 company, two Fortune 500
companies, and community groups (like MiR).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It has breadth</strong>: Chartability has evaluated
static and interactive data experiences made with Microsoft’s Excel and
PowerBI, Tableau, JavaScript (D3, Vega-Lite, Highcharts, Visa Chart
Components), Python (Altair, Bokeh, and matplotlib), R (ggplot2), as
well as design sketches and low/medium-fidelity artifacts (Illustrator,
Figma, Sketch).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When considering the analysis by Hurst and Kane about high
abandonment rates in assistive technology,&nbsp;<span class="citation" data-cites="hurst_making_2013">[<a href="#ref-hurst_making_2013" id="hurst_making_201311" aria-label="26, A. Hurst and S. Kane" title="26, A. Hurst and S. Kane">26</a>]</span> we wanted to make sure that we
created an artifact (assistive technology or otherwise) that would at
least survive its first year of use in the real world.</p>
<p>The greater community feedback as well as new research before and
after open-sourcing Chartability has also led to 5 new heuristics being
added since our test users performed audits and gave evaluations. The
current version of Chartability (v2) has a total of 50 heuristics.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the work of Chartability did not begin
and does not conclude with the publication of this manuscript. We want
Chartability to become a living, community-driven effort that will adapt
and grow as more resources, tools, and research become available.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>From our presentation of Chartability and a preliminary user
evaluation with data visualization and accessibility practitioners, we
learned that Chartability reduced the perception that working on
accessibility is difficult and increased the confidence of those new to
this work. Chartability shows promise as a useful framework for expert
accessibility practitioners because it serves to produce consistency in
contexts like the evaluation of dashboards, data science workflows, and
other complex, data-driven interfaces.</p>
<p>While our practitioners with novice accessibility experience were
initially concerned about doing the audit correctly, most of their audit
results were reasonably comparable with that of the authors (although
their time to complete was much longer).</p>
<p>We agree with experts that beyond Chartability, more resources are
needed which provide examples of both inaccessible and accessible data
visualizations as well as how to perform some of the more difficult
parts of the auditing process (such as evaluating with a screen reader).
We hope that keeping Chartability on GitHub will inspire future
improvements to address this gap in examples, and will address future
limitations, as we discover them.</p>
<p>Chartability is a valuable tool for auditing. But we also hope that
it can inspire researchers to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Examine which heuristics (in our supplemental materials) could
use more research attention, particularly those labelled “community
practice.”</p></li>
<li><p>Define constraints or requirements on novel projects, ensuring
that new explorations still respects established standards, mitigating
ethical risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the intersections of disability in ways yet unaddressed
in standards, such as the strong overlaps between understandability and
operability (like keyboard navigation patterns across a data structure)
or conflicts in understandability and flexibility (how some users need
redundant encodings on charts while others find this
overwhelming).</p></li>
<li><p>Consider access barriers in data experiences beyond those related
to visual perception.</p></li>
<li><p>Engage the relationship between labor and access in computing,
such as developing more measurements that demonstrate the imbalance of
time and effort expected of users with disabilities (even in systems
considered to provide “equal” access) and ways to evaluate who is
contributing to accessibility efforts in a project (core team members,
contractors, or volunteers).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We also want to caution researchers who are considering developing
heuristics or auditing tools for use in practitioner environments to
consider the tradeoffs between evaluation in rich, authentic
professional settings and concerns such as intellectual property and
corporate branding. We were able to apply our work in rich and
collaborative practitioner settings because we were permissive with our
potential participants. However, much of this work exists behind closed
doors, similar to the downsides of industry research settings. More work
may need to be done in order to encourage rich, cross-industry research
projects, such as helping to anonymize the content of intellectual
property and not just participants, while retaining data and
findings.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The demand for accessible data experiences is long overdue. The Web
Accessibility Initiative’s (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) are over 22 years old and yet little work has been done to
synthesize this large body of existing accessibility standards with
research and inclusive design principles relevant to the fields of data
communication, data science, data analysis, and visualization.
Chartability begins to address unique accessibility best practice gaps
in these domains with specific heuristics. This synthesis is meant to
empower researchers, analysts, designers, developers, editors, and
accessibility specialists with a framework to audit the accessibility of
data experiences, interfaces, and systems to produce more inclusive
environments for users with disabilities. The goal of Chartability is to
make this work easier in order to encourage practitioners to regard
current practices and resources, some of which have existed for
decades.</p>
<p>In addition, Chartability opens the door to more work that remains to
be explored in this space. Additional research is needed into many of
the topic areas within Chartability’s heuristic principles (POUR+CAF) as
well as resources, examples, and tools provided for practitioners to
perform this work more confidently and efficiently.</p>
<p>The changing landscape of visualization techniques and alternative
interfaces (such as sonification and dynamic tactile graphics) may
increase the demands for accessibility considerations in this space. The
growing technological divide will become an even greater human rights
issue as time moves on and we believe that tools like Chartability are
necessary for the community of data practitioners to ensure they are
including people with disabilities.</p>
